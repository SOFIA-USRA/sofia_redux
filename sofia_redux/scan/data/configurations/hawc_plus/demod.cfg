# Configuration for demodulated chopped-scans.

# Description:
# 	This configuration file is meant for use with demodulated
#       chopped-scan data.
# 
# ===========================================================================

# Do not use a flatfield, the demodulated data is flatfielded already
# Do not attempt to decorrelate on the analog chopper signal
# Do not decorrelate on scales smaller than the array
blacklist = pixeldata, correlated.chopper-x, correlated.chopper-y, biaslines,series, mux, rows
lock = drifts.value

# The demodulated data does not have inverted gains, it seems to be a factor
# of 2 lower than the total-power data.
gain = 0.5

# And since the data was flatfielded used fixed source gains, uncoupled to
# the correlated noise
[source]
    # Demodilated data will produce a dual-beam map. The source is positive
    # in one of the beams and negative in the other.

# Do not remove 1/f drifts, set 1/f timescale insanely large
