<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The SI Pipeline Users Manual (OP10) is intended for use by both SOFIA
Science Center staff during routine data processing and analysis, and
also as a reference for General Investigators (GIs) and archive users to
understand how the data in which they are interested was processed. This
manual is intended to provide all the needed information to execute the
SI Level 2/3/4 Pipeline, and assess the data quality of the
resulting products. It will also provide a description of the algorithms
used by the pipeline and both the final and intermediate data products.</p>
<p>A description of the current pipeline capabilities, testing results,
known issues, and installation procedures are documented in the SI
Pipeline Software Version Description Document (SVDD, SW06, DOCREF). The
overall Verification and Validation (V&amp;V) approach can be found in the
Data Processing System V&amp;V Plan (SV01-2232). Both documents can be
obtained from the SOFIA document library in Windchill.</p>
<p>This manual applies to FIFI-LS Redux version 2.7.0.</p>

<h3>FIFI-LS Instrument Information<a class="headerlink" href="#fifi-ls-instrument-information" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>FIFI-LS has two separate and independent grating spectrometers with
common fore-optics feeding two large Ge:Ga detector arrays (16 x 25
pixels each). The wavelength ranges of the two spectral channels are 42
- 110 microns and 110 - 210 microns, referred to as the BLUE and RED
channels, respectively.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Multiplexing takes place both spectrally and spatially. An image slicer
redistributes 5 x 5 pixel spatial fields-of-view (approximately
diffraction-limited in each wave band) along the 1 x 25 pixel entrance
slits of the spectrometers. Anamorphic collimator mirrors help keep the
spectrometer compact in the cross-dispersion direction. The spectrally
dispersed images of the slits are anamorphically projected onto the
detector arrays, to independently match spectral and spatial resolution
to detector size, thus enabling instantaneous coverage over a velocity
range of ~ 1500 to 3000 km/s around selected FIR spectral lines, for
each of the 25 spatial pixels (“spaxels”).</p>
<p>The detectors are read out with integrating amplifiers: at each pixel a
current proportional to the incident flux charges a capacitor. The
resulting voltage is sampled at about 256Hz. After a certain number of
read-outs (the ramp length), the capacitors are reset to prevent
saturation. Thus, the data consist of linearly rising ramps for which
the slope is proportional to the flux. See <a class="reference internal" href="#fifi-readout-sequence"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 20</span></a>
for an illustration of the read-out sequence.</p>

<h3>FIFI-LS Observing Modes<a class="headerlink" href="#fifi-ls-observing-modes" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Symmetric chop mode, also known as nod-match-chop mode, is the most
common observing mode. In this mode, the telescope chops
symmetrically to its optical axis, with a matched telescope nod to
remove background. A typical observation sequence will cycle through the
A nod position and the B nod position in an ABBA pattern.</p>
<p>Most observations will be taken using symmetric chop mode. However, if
the object is very bright, the efficiency is improved by observing in an
asymmetric chopping mode. This mode typically consists of two map
positions and one off-position per nod-cycle (an AAB pattern, where the
B position contains only empty sky). Asymmetric chopping may also be
used if an object’s size requires a larger chop throw than is possible
with symmetric chopping.</p>

mode (left) and the asymmetric mode (right).</span><a class="headerlink" href="#fifi-chop-nod-geometry" title="Link to this image">¶</a></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Occasionally, for very bright targets, it may be advantageous to take
data with no chopping at all. This mode, called total power mode, may be
taken with either symmetric or asymmetric nodding for sky subtraction,
or with no nods at all.</p>
<p>For extended targets, total power observations may also be taken
in on-the-fly (OTF) scanning mode.  In this mode, the telescope is
continuously scanned across the target, at a speed calculated for minimal
smearing within a single ramp.  Each ramp is then treated as if it were
a separate observation (A nod), with its own position coordinates.
The sky position (B nod) may be observed separately, before or after the
OTF scan, similar to the asymmetric nodding method.  The sky position is
not scanned.</p>
<p>At each chop and nod position (on- and off-position), it is common to
step the grating through a number of positions before each telescope move.
These additional grating scans effectively increase the wavelength
coverage of the observation.  Note, however, that grating scans are not
used with the OTF mode, due to the continuous telescope motion.</p>

<h3>Reduction Algorithms<a class="headerlink" href="#reduction-algorithms" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The following subsections detail each of the data reduction pipeline
steps outlined in the flowchart above.</p>
<section id="split-grating-and-chop">
<h4>Split Grating and Chop<a class="headerlink" href="#split-grating-and-chop" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>A single FIFI-LS raw FITS file contains the data from both chop
positions (on and off) for each grating step used in a single nod
position. FIFI-LS records its grating positions in “inductosyn” units.
These are long integer values that are used to convert the data to a
micron scale in the wavelength calibrate step.</p>
<p>The raw FIFI-LS data consist of a header (metadata describing the
observation) and a table of voltage readings from the detector pixels.
Each data section contains one frame, i.e. simultaneous readouts of all
detector pixels and grating values.</p>
<p>The data header is sent before each frame. The following 8 unsigned
16-bit words contain the header information.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Word 0: The word #8000 marks the start of the header.</p></li>
<li><p>Word 1: The low word of the 32-bit frame counter.</p></li>
<li><p>Word 2: The high word of the 32-bit frame counter.</p></li>
<li><p>Word 3: The flag word. Bit 0 is the chopper signal. Bit 1 is the
detector (0=red, 1=blue). Unused bits are fixed to 1 to recognize
this flag word.</p></li>
<li><p>Word 4: The sample count as defined in the timing diagrams (see
<a class="reference internal" href="#fifi-readout-sequence"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 20</span></a>). This count gets advanced at every sync pulse and
reset at every long sync pulse.</p></li>
<li><p>Word 5: The ramp count as defined in the timing diagrams. This
counter gets advanced with a long sync pulse and reset by RCRES.</p></li>
<li><p>Word 6: The scan index</p></li>
<li><p>Word 7: A spare word (for now used as “end of header”: #7FFF).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Only columns 3, 4, and 5 are used in the split grating/chop step. The
following shows example header values for a raw RED FIFI-LS file:</p>

<p>Column 3 is all ones, indicating that the data is for the RED
channel, column 4 counts the readouts from 0 to 31, and
column 5 indicates the ramp number.</p>
<p>Where each chop and grating position starts and stops in the raw data
table is determined using the header keywords RAMPLN_[B,R],
C_CYC_[B,R], C_CHOPLN, G_PSUP_[B,R], G_PSDN_[B,R] keywords. A RED
data example is as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>RAMPLN_R= 32 / number of readouts per red ramp
C_CHOPLN= 64 / number of readouts per chop position
G_PSUP_R= 5  / number of grating position up in one cycle
G_PSDN_R= 0  / number of grating position down in one cycle
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Here, C_CHOPLN / RAMPLN_R is 64 / 32 = 2; therefore, there are 2 ramps
per chop.</p>
<p>Each chop switch index is determined using the 5<sup>th</sup> column in
the header. It is chop 0 if the value is odd and chop 1 if the value is
even. Grating scan information determines how that chop phase is split
up into separate extensions using the following formula:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[binsize = (nreadout * ramplength) / (nstep * choplength)\]</div>
<p>where <em>nreadout</em> is the total number of readouts (frames) in the file,
<em>ramplength</em> is determined by the appropriate RAMPLN keyword, <em>nstep</em> is
the number of grating steps (G_PSDN + G_PSUP), and <em>choplength</em> is the
number of readouts per chop position (C_CHOPLN).</p>
<p>The binary data section is comprised of 468 signed 16-bit words: one
each for 25 spaxels, plus one control value, times 18 spectral channels
(“spexels”). The spaxels are read out one spectral channel at a time.
Spectral channel zero of all 25 pixels are read out, and then a grating
value (analog readout from the grating mechanism) is recorded; then the
next channel of all the pixels is read out, and then the next grating
value, and so on, through all the spectral channels. The grating values
may be during pipeline processing to discard samples with inconsistent
grating positions, but are then discarded for further processing. Of the
18 spectral channels, channel 0 is the CRE resistor row and row 17 is
the empty CRE row (“dummy channel”). The empty row may be used during
processing, to help remove correlated noise from a spaxel. These two channels
are then discarded; the other 16 channels are considered valid spexels.</p>
<p>The first step in the data reduction pipeline is to split out the data
from each grating scan position into separate FITS image extensions, and to
save all grating positions from a single chop position into a common file.
For example, if there are five grating scans per chop, and two chop
positions, then a single one-extension input raw FITS file will be
reorganized into two files (chop 0 and chop 1) with 5 extensions each.
For total power mode, there is only one chop position, so there will be
one output file, with one extension for each grating step. Each
extension in the output FITS files contains the data array corresponding
to the grating position recorded in its header (keyword INDPOS).
Hereafter, in the pipeline, until the Combine Grating Scans step, each
grating scan is handled separately.</p>
<p>For OTF mode data, an additional binary table is attached to the FITS file,
recording the telescope position at each readout sample.  These positions
are calculated from the telescope speed keywords in the FITS header
(OBSLAMV and OBSBETV, for RA and Dec speeds in arcsec/s, respectively).
Readouts taken before and after the telescope scanning motion are also
identified using the OTFSTART and TRK_DRTN header keywords.  These
readouts are flagged in the SCANPOS table for removal from consideration
in later pipeline steps.</p>
</section>
<section id="fit-ramps">
<h4>Fit Ramps<a class="headerlink" href="#fit-ramps" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>The flux measured in each spatial and spectral pixel is reconstructed
from the readout frames by fitting a line to the voltage ramps. The
slope of the line corresponds to the flux value.</p>
<p>Before fitting a line to a ramp, some likely bad frames are removed from
the data. The grating values (in the 26<sup>th</sup> spaxel position), the
first ramp from each spaxel, the first 2-3 readouts per ramp, and
the last readout per ramp are all removed before fitting.</p>
<p>Optionally, the flux in the first (empty) spectral pixel may be subtracted
from all other spexels in its associated spaxel, as a correction for
detector readout bias.  The dummy channels in the first and last spectral
pixels are then removed from the flux array; they are not propagated
through the rest of the pipeline.</p>
<p>Additionally, the grating values in the spare spaxel may be used to
identify ramps for which the grating deviated from the expected position.
The grating values are averaged over a ramp, and compared to the expected
value.  If they do not fall within a threshold of the expected position,
the ramp is flagged for rejection.</p>
<p>A ramp may be marked as saturated if
it does not have its highest peak in the last readout of the ramp. If
this occurs, the readout before the highest peak is removed before
fitting, along with any readouts after it. This ensures that the slope
is not contaminated by any non-linearity near the saturation point.</p>
<p>Typically, multiple ramps are taken at each chop position. After the
slope of each ramp is derived, the slopes are combined with a robust
weighted mean. This final averaged value is recorded as the flux for the
pixel and the error on the mean is recorded as the error on the flux for
that pixel. After this pipeline step, there is a flux value for each
spatial and spectral pixel, recorded in a 25 x 16 data array in a
separate FITS image extension for each grating scan. The error values
are recorded in a separate 25 x 16 array, in another FITS image
extension.  The extensions are named with a suffix indicating the grating
scan number.  For example, for two grating scans, the output will have
extensions FLUX_G0, STDDEV_G0, FLUX_G1, and STDDEV_G1.</p>
<p>For OTF data, each ramp represents a different sky position, so separate ramps
are not averaged together, but are propagated through the pipeline as a data
cube.  The flux and error data arrays have dimension 25 x 16 x N<sub>ramp</sub>,
where N<sub>ramp</sub> is the number of ramps for which the telescope motion was
nominal.  In the SCANPOS table attached to the FITS file, the telescope
positions for each ramp are calculated from an average over the positions
for the readouts in the ramp, and propagated forward for later use in spatial
calibration.</p>
<p>Some pixels in the data array may be set to not-a-number (NaN). These
are either known bad detector pixels, or pixels for which the ramp fits
did not have sufficient signal-to-noise. These pixels will be ignored in
all further reduction steps.</p>

<h4>Subtract Chops<a class="headerlink" href="#subtract-chops" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>To remove instrument and sky background emission, the data from the two
chop positions must be subtracted. For A nods in symmetric mode, chop 1
is subtracted from chop 0. For B nods in symmetric mode, chop 0 is
subtracted from chop 1. All resulting source flux in the symmetric chop-subtracted
data should therefore be positive, so that the nods are combined only by
addition. In asymmetric mode, chop 1 is subtracted from chop 0 regardless
of nod position.</p>
<p>This pipeline step produces one output file for each pair of input chop
files. In total power mode, no chop subtraction is performed.</p>

<h4>Combine Nods<a class="headerlink" href="#combine-nods" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>After the chops are subtracted, the nods must be combined to remove
residual background.</p>
<p>In symmetric chopping mode, the A nods are paired to adjacent B nods. In
order to match a given A nod, a B nod must have been taken at the same
dither position (FITS header keywords DLAM_MAP and DBET_MAP), and with
the same grating position (INDPOS). The B nod meeting these conditions
and taken nearest in time to the A nod (keyword DATE-OBS) is added to
the A nod.</p>
<p>In asymmetric mode, a single B nod may be subtracted from multiple A nods. For
example, in an AAB pattern the B nod is combined with each preceding A
nod. The B nods in this mode need not have been taken at the same dither
position as the A nods, but the grating position must still match. The
matching B nod taken nearest in time is subtracted from each A nod.</p>
<p>Optionally, in asymmetric mode, the nearest B nods before and after the A
nod may be combined before subtracting from the A nod, either by averaging
them, or by linearly interpolating their values to the time of the A nod
observation.  In some cases, this may reduce background artifacts resulting
from changes in the sky background between the A and B nod observations.</p>
<p>This pipeline step produces an output file for each input A nod file,
containing the chop- and nod-combined flux and error values for each
grating scan.</p>

<p>In order to correct for variations in response among the individual

for the differences in spatial and spectral response across the
detector. There is a normalized spatial flat field for each of the RED
and BLUE channels, in each of the dichroics, which specifies the correction
for each spaxel.  This correction may vary over time.  There is also a set of
spectral flat fields, for each channel, order, and dichroic, over the full

<p>In order to apply the flat fields to the data, the pipeline interpolates
the appropriate spectral flat onto the wavelengths of the observation, for
each spexel, then multiplies the value by the appropriate spatial flat.
The flux is then divided by this correction value.  The updated flux and
associated error values are stored in the FLUX_G<em>i</em> and STDDDEV_G<em>i</em>

<p>Due to slight variations in the readout electronics, there may
be additive offsets in the overall flux level recorded in each

the mean value of all pixels in the overlapping wavelength regions for

subtracted from each grating scan, in order to set all extensions to a
common bias level.</p>

the result in a single data array with dimensions 25 x (16 * N<sub>scan</sub>),
where N<sub>scan</sub> is the total number of grating scans in the input file. Note
that the wavelengths are still irregularly sampled at this point, due to the

<section id="telluric-correct">
<h4>Telluric Correct<a class="headerlink" href="#telluric-correct" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Telluric correction is the process of attempting to correct an observed
spectrum for absorption by molecules in the earth’s atmosphere, in order
to recover the intrinsic (“exo-atmospheric”) spectrum of the source. The
atmospheric molecular components (primarily water, ozone, CO2) can
produce both broad absorption features that are well resolved by FIFI-LS
and narrow, unresolved features. The strongest absorption features are
expected to be due to water. Because SOFIA travels quite large distances
during even short observing legs, the water vapor content along the line
of sight through the atmosphere can vary substantially on fairly short
timescales during an observation. Therefore, observing a “telluric
standard,” as is usually done for ground-based observations, will not
necessarily provide an accurate absorption correction spectrum. For this
reason, telluric corrections of FIFI-LS data rely on models of the
atmospheric absorption, as provided by codes such as ATRAN, in
combination with the estimated line-of-sight water vapor content
(precipitable water vapor, PWV) provided by the water vapor monitor
(WVM) aboard SOFIA. Currently, the WVM does not generate PWV values that
are inserted into the FITS headers of the FIFI-LS data files. It is
expected that these values may become available in the future, and
at that point the PWV values will be used to generate telluric
correction spectra.</p>
<p>Currently, correction spectra are generated using
PWV values derived from observations of telluric lines made with FIFI-LS
during the set-up period at the start of observing legs and after changes
of altitude. Experience has shown that these provide better corrections
than simply using the expected value for the flight altitude and airmass,
particularly in regions with deep, sharp features (e.g. near 63 microns).
However, changes of PWV during flight legs are not monitored and this may
cause inaccuracies if the value changes rapidly. Furthermore, accurate
correction of spectral lines in the vicinity of narrow telluric absorption
features is problematic even with the use of good atmospheric models and
knowledge of the PWV. This is due to the fact that the observed spectrum is
the result of a multiplication of the intrinsic spectrum by the telluric
absorption spectrum, and then a convolution of the product with the
instrumental profile, whereas the correction derived from a model is the
result of the convolution of the theoretical telluric absorption
spectrum with the instrumental profile. The division of the former by
the latter does not necessarily yield the correct results, and the
output spectrum may retain telluric artifacts after telluric correction.</p>
<p>A set of ATRAN models appropriate for a range of altitudes, zenith
angles, and PWV values has been generated for pipeline use. In the
telluric correction step, the pipeline selects the model closest to the
observed altitude, zenith angle, and PWV value and smooths the transmission
model to the resolution of the observed spectrum, interpolates the transmission
data to the observed wavelength at each spexel, and
then divides the data by the transmission model. Very low transmission
values result in poor corrections, so any pixel for which the transmission
is less than 60% (by default) is set to NaN. For reference, the smoothed,
binned transmission data is attached to the FITS file as a 25 x (16 *
N<sub>scan</sub>) data array (extension ATRAN).  The original unsmoothed data is
attached as well, in the extension UNSMOOTHED_ATRAN.</p>
<p>Since the telluric correction may introduce artifacts, or may, at some
wavelength settings, produce flux cubes for which all pixels are set to
NaN, the pipeline also propagates the uncorrected flux cube through the
remaining reduction steps. The telluric-corrected cube and its
associated error are stored in the FLUX and STDDEV extensions.
The uncorrected cube and its associated error are stored in the
UNCORRECTED_FLUX and UNCORRECTED_STDDEV extensions.</p>

<h4>Flux Calibrate<a class="headerlink" href="#flux-calibrate" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Flux calibration of FIFI-LS data is carried out via the division of the
instrumental response, as recorded in response files appropriate for
each grating setting, wavelength range, and dichroic. The response
values have units of ADU/s/Hz/Jy and are derived from observations of “flux
standards.” At the wavelengths at which FIFI-LS operates, there are very
few stars bright enough to yield high signal-to-noise data useful for
flux calibration purposes. Therefore, observations of asteroids,
planets, and planetary moons are used, along with models of such
objects, to derive the response curves. Since the observed fluxes of
such solar system objects vary with time, the models must be generated
for the time of each specific observation. To date, observations of Mars
have been used as the primary flux calibration source. Predicted total
fluxes for Mars across the FIFI-LS passband at the specific UT dates of
the observations have been generated using the model of Lellouch and
Amri. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#fn-fifi-mars" id="id1" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> Predicted fluxes at several frequencies have been computed
and these have then been fit with blackbody curves to derive values at a
large number of wavelength points. The deviations of the fits from the
input predictions are much less than 1%. After the models have been
generated, the telluric-corrected spectra of the standards, in units of
ADU/s/Hz, are divided by the theoretical spectra, in Jy. The results are
smoothed and then fit with a polynomial to derive response functions
(ADU/s/Hz/Jy) that can then used to flux calibrate the telluric-corrected
spectra of other astronomical sources (see <a class="reference internal" href="#fifi-response"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 31</span></a>).</p>

<p>The pipeline stores a set of response functions for each channel and
dichroic value. To perform flux calibration, it selects the correct
response function for each input observation, interpolates the response
onto the wavelengths of each spexel, and divides the flux by the
response value to convert it to physical units (Jy/pixel). From this point on,
the data products are considered to be Level 3 (FITS keyword
PROCSTAT=LEVEL_3). For reference, the resampled response data is
attached to the FITS file as a 25 x (16 * N<sub>scan</sub>) data table in the
first FITS extension (column RESPONSE). Flux calibration is applied to
both the telluric-corrected cube and the uncorrected cube. The estimated
systematic error in the flux calibration is recorded in the CALERR
keyword in the FITS header, as an average fractional error. At this
time, flux calibration is expected to be good to within about 5-10%
(CALERR <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\leq\)</span> 0.1). <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#fn-fifi-calerr" id="id2" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>2<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>

<section id="correct-wave-shift">
<h4>Correct Wave Shift<a class="headerlink" href="#correct-wave-shift" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Due to the motion of the Earth with respect to the barycenter of the solar
system, the wavelengths of features in the spectra of astronomical sources
will appear to be slightly shifted, by different amounts on different
observation dates. In order to avoid introducing a broadening of
spectral features when multiple observations obtained over different
nights are combined, the wavelength calibration of FIFI-LS observations
must be adjusted to remove the barycentric wavelength shift. This shift
is calculated as an expected wavelength shift (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d\lambda / \lambda\)</span>),
from the radial velocity of the earth with respect to the solar barycenter
on the observation date, toward the RA and Dec of the observed target.
This shift is recorded in the header keyword BARYSHFT, and applied to the
wavelength calibration in the LAMBDA extension as:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\lambda' = \lambda + \lambda(d\lambda/\lambda)\]</div>
<p>Since the telluric absorption lines do not change with the motion of the
earth, the barycentric wavelength shift cannot be applied to
non-telluric-corrected data. Doing so would result in a spectrum in
which both the intrinsic features and the telluric lines are shifted.
Therefore, the unshifted wavelength calibration is also propagated in
the output file, in the extension UNCORRECTED_LAMBDA.</p>
<p>It is possible to apply an additional wavelength shift to correct for the
solar system’s velocity with respect to the local standard of rest (LSR).
This shift is calculated and stored in the header keyword LSRSHFT, but it
is not applied to the wavelength calibration. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#fn-fifi-waveshift" id="id3" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>3<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>

<h4>Resample<a class="headerlink" href="#resample" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Finally, the pipeline resamples the flux for each spatial and spectral pixel
onto a regular 3D grid (right ascension, declination, and wavelength).
This step combines the spatial information from all input
nod-combined dither positions into a single output map.  See
<a class="reference internal" href="#fifi-resample-algorithm"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 32</span></a> for an overview of the resampling algorithm.</p>

<section id="grid-size">
<h5>Grid Size<a class="headerlink" href="#grid-size" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h5>
<p>The pipeline first determines the maximum and minimum wavelengths and spatial
offsets present in all input files by projecting all dither positions for the
observation into a common world coordinate system (WCS) reference frame.
For OTF data, the scan positions for each ramp in each input
file are also considered.  The full range of sky positions and wavelengths
observed sets the range of the output grid.</p>
<p>The spacing of the output grid in the wavelength dimension (dw) is set
by the desired oversampling. By default, in the wavelength dimension, the
pipeline samples the average expected spectral FWHM for the observation
(<a class="reference internal" href="#fifi-spatial-res"><span class="std std-numref">Table 5</span></a>) with 8 output pixels.</p>
<p>The spacing in the spatial dimensions (dx) is fixed for each channel
at 1.5 arcseconds in the BLUE and 3.0 arcseconds in the RED. These values
are chosen to ensure an oversampling of the spatial FWHM by at least a
factor of three.</p>
<p>For example, for the RED observation in the figures above, the expected
spectral FWHM at the central wavelength is 0.13 um, so sampling this FWHM
with 8 pixels creates a grid with a spectral width of 0.016 um. Given a
min and max wavelength of 157.27 um and 158.48 um, the output grid will
sample the full range of wavelengths with 76 spectral pixels. Since it is
a RED channel observation, the spatial scale will be 3.0 arcseconds. If
the range of x offsets is -41.0 to 57.74 and the range of y offsets is
-43.9 to 36.9, then the output spatial grid will have dimensions 33 x 27,
with an oversampling of the FWHM (using the interpolated value at
157.876 um of 15.6 arcseconds) of 5.2. The full output cube then is
33 x 27 x 76 (nx x ny x nw).</p>
<p>In the spatial dimensions, the flux in each pixel represents an integrated
flux over the area of the pixel.  Since the pixel width changes
after resampling, the output flux must be corrected for flux conservation.
To do so, the resampled flux is multiplied by the
area of the new pixel (<em>dx</em><sup>2</sup>), divided by the intrinsic area of
the spaxel (approximately 36 arcseconds<sup>2</sup> for BLUE, 144
arcseconds<sup>2</sup> for RED).</p>

<section id="algorithm">
<h5>Algorithm<a class="headerlink" href="#algorithm" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h5>
<p>For each pixel in the 3D output grid, the resampling algorithm finds
all flux values with assigned wavelengths and spatial positions
within a fitting window, typically 0.5 times the spectral
FWHM in the wavelength dimension, and 3 times the spatial FWHM in the
spatial dimensions. For the spatial grid, a larger fit window is typically
necessary than for the spectral grid, since the observation setup
usually allows more oversampling in wavelength than in space.</p>
<p>Then, a low-order 3D polynomial surface is fit to all the good data
points within the window.  The fit is weighted by the error on the flux,
as calculated by the pipeline, and a Gaussian function of the distance
of the input data value from the grid location. The distance weighting
function may be held constant for each output pixel, or it may optionally
be allowed to vary in scale and shape in response to the input data
characteristics.  This adaptive smoothing kernel may help in preserving
peak flux values for bright, compact flux regions, but may over-fit the input
data in some sparsely sampled observations
(see <a class="reference internal" href="#fifi-resample-comparison"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 33</span></a>).</p>
<p>The output flux value for this algorithm is the value of the fit
polynomial surface, evaluated at the grid location, and the associated error
is the error on the fit (see <a class="reference internal" href="#fifi-flux-slice"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 34</span></a>).</p>
<p>Output grid locations for which there was insufficient input data for
stable polynomial fits are set to NaN.  The threshold for how much output
data is considered invalid is a tunable parameter, but it is typically
set to eliminate most edge effect artifacts from the final output cube.</p>
<p>For some types of observations, especially undithered observations of
point sources for which the spatial FWHM is undersampled, the
polynomial surface fits may not return good results. In these cases, it
is beneficial to use an alternate resampling algorithm. In this
algorithm, the master grid is determined as above, but each
input file is resampled with polynomial fits in the wavelength dimension only.
Then, for each wavelength plane, the spatial data is interpolated
onto the grid, using radial basis function interpolation. Areas of the spatial
grid for which there is no data in the input file are set to NaN. The
interpolated cubes are then mean-combined, ignoring any NaNs, to produce
the final output cube.</p>
<p>For either algorithm, the pipeline also generates an exposure map cube
indicating the number of observations of the source that were taken at
each pixel (see <a class="reference internal" href="#fifi-exposure-map"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 35</span></a>). These exposure counts
correspond to the sum over the projection of the detector field of view
for each input observation onto the output grid.  The exposure map may
not exactly match the valid data locations in the flux cube, since additional
flagging and pixel rejection occurs during the resampling algorithms.</p>
</section>
<section id="uncorrected-flux-cube">
<h5>Uncorrected Flux Cube<a class="headerlink" href="#uncorrected-flux-cube" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h5>
<p>Both the telluric-corrected and the uncorrected flux cubes are resampled
in this step, onto the same 3D grid. However, the
telluric-corrected cube is resampled using the wavelengths corrected for
barycentric motion, and the uncorrected cube is resampled using the
original wavelength calibration. The spectra from the uncorrected cube
will appear slightly shifted with respect to the spectra from the
telluric-corrected cube.</p>
</section>
<section id="detector-coordinates">
<h5>Detector Coordinates<a class="headerlink" href="#detector-coordinates" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h5>
<p>For most observations, the output grid is determined from projected sky
coordinates for each input data point, for the most accurate astrometry
in the output map.  However, this is undesirable for nonsidereal data, for
which the sky coordinates of the target change over the course of the
observation.  For nonsidereal sources, the detector offsets
(from input XS and YS extensions) are used instead
of the sky coordinates (from RA and DEC extensions) to generate the output grid.
For all other sources, detector coordinates may optionally be used instead of
sky coordinates if desired.</p>
</section>
<section id="additional-scan-processing">
<h5>Additional Scan Processing<a class="headerlink" href="#additional-scan-processing" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h5>
<p>For OTF data, the standard sky subtraction and flat correction algorithms
may not be sufficient to remove residual sky and detector noise.  In this
mode, temporal variations frequently result in artifacts like striping along
the scan direction, or residual sky backgrounds that overwhelm diffuse
emission.</p>
<p>In this case, it may be beneficial to apply an iterative correction to the
detector gain and noise.  For OTF data, the FIFI-LS pipeline provides this
correction as an optional scan reduction step, just prior to resampling.
The iterative scan reduction algorithm is described at length in the
<a class="reference external" href="https://sofia-usra.github.io/sofia_redux/manuals/hawc/users/users.html#scan-reduction-algorithms">HAWC+ pipeline user’s manual</a>
and in the software documentation for the
<a class="reference external" href="https://sofia-usra.github.io/sofia_redux/sofia_redux/scan/index.html">sofia_redux.scan module</a>.</p>
<p>At this time, this feature should be considered experimental.  The scan
algorithms have a number of complex, interlinked parameters that have not
yet been fully tested and optimized for FIFI-LS data.</p>
</section>
<section id="output-data">
<h5>Output Data<a class="headerlink" href="#output-data" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h5>
<p>The pipeline stores the resampled data as a 3D FITS image extension
with extension name FLUX. The associated error is stored in a
separate extension, with the name ERROR. The non-telluric-corrected
cubes are stored in UNCORRECTED_FLUX and UNCORRECTED_ERROR extensions,
respectively. The output wavelengths, x and y offsets, and RA and Dec
coordinates are stored in WAVELENGTH, X, Y, RA—TAN, and DEC–TAN
extensions.</p>
<p>For reference, a model of the atmospheric
transmission spectrum, smoothed to the resolution of the observation,
and the instrumental response curve used in flux calibration are also
attached to the FITS file in 1D extensions called TRANSMISSION and
RESPONSE.</p>
<p>Finally, an unsmoothed transmission spectrum is attached in a 2D
image extension called UNSMOOTHED_TRANSMISSION. This extension will have size
N<sub>trans</sub> x 2, where N<sub>trans</sub> is the number of data points in the
spectrum, the first row is the wavelength array, and the second row is
the transmission fraction. This spectrum may be useful for further analysis
of the data (e.g. for determining the total flux in an emission line).</p>
<p>The final output from the pipeline is a FITS file with 11 image
extensions:</p>

<h3>Data Format<a class="headerlink" href="#data-format" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>All files produced by the pipeline are multi-extension FITS files, for
which the primary HDU contains only the primary header, and all data is
contained in separate extensions.</p>
<p>For standard chop/nod modes, all output extensions are FITS image
extensions. Pipeline steps prior to the Combine Scans step output one
extension of each type for each of N<sub>scan</sub> grating scans performed.
Intermediate flux and error data for all steps after the Fit Ramps step are 2D
arrays (spaxel x spexel); the final product contains 3D spectral cubes
(RA x Dec x wavelength).</p>
<p>For the OTF mode, intermediate data files produced by pipeline steps prior to
the Spatial Calibrate step additionally contain a binary table holding
sky position data for each scan position (extension SCANPOS_G0). Intermediate
flux and error data in this mode are 3D cubes (spaxel x spexel x scan position).
The final product is identical to other modes.</p>

<h2>Grouping LEVEL_1 data for processing<a class="headerlink" href="#grouping-level-1-data-for-processing" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>FIFI-LS observations of a single object may dither in wavelength and/or
in space. It is common to use a set of FIFI-LS observations to map out
large regions of diffuse emission in a few small wavelength regions, but
it is also common to use FIFI-LS to take a set of observations of a
compact source over a wide range of wavelengths. As such, observations
cannot simply be split on the central wavelength, or the base positions
of the observation. Grouping relies on a keyword, FILEGPID, which
defines a set of observations that should be reduced together to produce
one final spectral map. In addition, however, observations must always
be separated by detector channel, dichroic setting, nodding style
(symmetric vs. asymmetric), observation type (source vs. sky flat), and
the observational program ID. It may also be desirable to group file by
the observation ID (AOR-ID), but this is considered optional. This is
due to the fact that, because FIFI-LS incorporates a dichroic, different
AORs can have the same grating setting for one of the two detectors. In
such cases, the data sets with the same settings should be combined even
though the AORs are different. All of these requirements together define
a set of FITS keywords that must match in order for a group of input
files to be reduced together (see <a class="reference internal" href="#fifi-grouping"><span class="std std-numref">Table 7</span></a>).</p>

<h3>Installation<a class="headerlink" href="#installation" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The FIFI-LS pipeline is written entirely in Python.  The pipeline is
platform independent, but has been tested only on Linux and Mac OS X
operating systems.  Running the pipeline requires a minimum of 16GB RAM,
or equivalent-sized swap file.</p>
<p>The pipeline is primarily comprised of four modules within the <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sofia_redux</span></code>
package: <a class="reference internal" href="../../../sofia_redux/instruments/fifi_ls/index.html#module-sofia_redux.instruments.fifi_ls" title="sofia_redux.instruments.fifi_ls"><code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sofia_redux.instruments.fifi_ls</span></code></a>, <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sofia_redux.pipeline</span></code>,
<code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sofia_redux.spectroscopy</span></code>, and <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sofia_redux.toolkit</span></code>. Additional optional

modules.</p>
<p>The <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fifi_ls</span></code> module provides the data processing
algorithms, with supporting libraries from the <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">toolkit</span></code> and <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">spectroscopy</span></code>
modules.  The <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pipeline</span></code> module provides interactive and batch interfaces
to the pipeline algorithms.  The <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">calibration</span></code> module is used to provide
interactive photometry routines in the interactive interface.  The <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">scan</span></code>
module provides support for additional processing tasks specific to on-the-fly
mapping modes.</p>
<section id="external-requirements">
<h4>External Requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#external-requirements" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>To run the pipeline for any mode, Python 3.8 or
higher is required, as well as the following packages: numpy, scipy,
matplotlib, pandas, astropy, configobj, numba, bottleneck, joblib,
and astropy-helpers.
Some display functions for the graphical user interface (GUI)
additionally require the PyQt5, pyds9, photutils, and dill packages.
All required external packages are available to install via the
pip or conda package managers.  See the Anaconda environment file
(environment.yml), or the pip requirements file (requirements.txt)
distributed with <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sofia_redux</span></code> for specific version requirements.</p>
<p>Running the pipeline interactively also requires an installation of
SAO DS9 for FITS image display. See <a class="reference external" href="http://ds9.si.edu/">http://ds9.si.edu/</a> for download
and installation instructions.  The <em>ds9</em> executable
must be available in the PATH environment variable for the pyds9
interface to be able to find and control it.</p>
</section>
<section id="source-code-installation">
<h4>Source Code Installation<a class="headerlink" href="#source-code-installation" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>The source code for the FIFI-LS pipeline maintained by the SOFIA Data
Processing Systems (DPS) team can be obtained directly from the
DPS, or from the external <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/SOFIA-USRA/sofia_redux">GitHub repository</a>.
This repository contains all needed configuration
files, auxiliary files, and Python code to run the pipeline on FIFI-LS
data in any observation mode.</p>
<p>After obtaining the source code, install the four Python libraries with
the command:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>python setup.py install
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>from the top-level directory.</p>
<p>Alternately, a development installation may be performed from inside the
directory with the command:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pip install -e .
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>After installation, the top-level pipeline interface commands should
be available in the PATH.  Typing:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>redux
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>from the command line should launch the GUI interface, and:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>redux_pipe -h
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>should display a brief help message for the command line interface.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="configuration">
<h3>Configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#configuration" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>For FIFI-LS algorithms, default parameter values are defined by the
Redux object that interfaces to them. These values may be overridden
manually for each step, while running in interactive mode. They may also
be overridden by an input parameter file, in INI format, in either
interactive or automatic mode. See Appendix A for an example of an input
parameter file, which contains the current defaults for all parameters.</p>
<p>Requirements for input header keywords are also specified in a
configuration file, called <em>headerdef.dat</em>, located in the <em>fifi_ls/data</em>
package directory. This table lists the keyword name, whether it is a
value required to be present in the input headers, its default value,
the data type of the value, and any requirements on the value range
(minimum value, maximum value, or enumerated value). The table also
defines how keywords from multiple input files should be combined for a
single output file (e.g. take the first value, take the sum,
string-concatenate, etc.). A sample of this configuration file is also
given in Appendix A. All keywords present in the table will be written
to output files produced by the FIFI-LS Redux pipeline.</p>
</section>
<section id="input-data">
<h3>Input data<a class="headerlink" href="#input-data" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Redux takes as input raw FIFI-LS FITS data files, which contain unsigned
tables. The number of frames per raw data cube depends on the readout
mode used to acquire the data. The FITS headers contain data acquisition
and observation parameters and, combined with the pipeline configuration
files, comprise the information necessary to complete all steps of the
data reduction process. Some critical keywords are required to be
present in the raw data in order to perform a successful grouping,
reduction, and ingestion into the SOFIA archive (see Appendix A).</p>
<p>It is assumed that the input data have been successfully grouped before
beginning reduction: Redux considers all input files in a reduction to
be science files that are part of a single homogeneous reduction group,
to be reduced together with the same parameters.</p>
<section id="auxiliary-files">
<h4>Auxiliary Files<a class="headerlink" href="#auxiliary-files" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>In order to complete a standard reduction, the pipeline requires a number
of auxiliary files to be on disk, in standard locations within the
<em>fifi_ls/data</em> package directory.  These files may be overridden in custom
reductions, using input parameters for the relevant pipeline steps.  See
<a class="reference internal" href="#fifi-auxfiles"><span class="std std-numref">Table 8</span></a> for a table of all commonly used types of auxiliary
files.</p>

<h3>Automatic Mode Execution<a class="headerlink" href="#automatic-mode-execution" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The DPS pipeline infrastructure runs a pipeline on previously-defined
reduction groups as a fully-automatic black box. To do so, it creates an
input manifest (<em>infiles.txt</em>) that contains relative paths to the input
files (one per line). The command-line interface to the
pipeline is run as:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>redux_pipe infiles.txt
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The command-line interface will read in the specified input files, use
their headers to determine the observation mode, and accordingly
the steps to run and any intermediate files to save. Output files are
written to the current directory, from which the pipeline was called.
After reduction is complete, the script will generate an output manifest
(<em>outfiles.txt</em>) containing the relative paths to all output FITS files
generated by the pipeline.</p>
<p>Optionally, in place of a manifest file, file paths to input files may
be directly specified on the command line.  Input files may be raw
FITS files, or may be intermediate products previously produced
by the pipeline.  For example, this command will complete the reduction
for a set of FITS files in the current directory, previously reduced
through the calibration step of the pipeline:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>redux_pipe *CAL*.fits
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To customize batch reductions from the command line, the <em>redux_pipe</em> interface
accepts a configuration file on the command line.  This file may contain
any subset of the full configuration file, specifying any non-default
parameters for pipeline steps.  An output directory for pipeline products
and the terminal log level may also be set on the command line.</p>
<p>The full set of optional command-line parameters accepted by the <em>redux_pipe</em>
interface are:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>-h, --help            show this help message and exit
-c CONFIG, --configuration CONFIG
                      Path to Redux configuration file.
-o OUTDIR, --out OUTDIR
                      Path to output directory.
-l LOGLEVEL, --loglevel LOGLEVEL
                      Log level.

<h3>Manual Mode Execution<a class="headerlink" href="#manual-mode-execution" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>In manual mode, the pipeline may be run interactively, via a graphical
user interface (GUI) provided by the Redux package.  The GUI is launched by
the command:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>redux
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>entered at the terminal prompt (<a class="reference internal" href="#fifi-ls-startup"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 36</span></a>).  The GUI allows
output directory specification, but it may write initial or temporary
files to the current directory, so it is recommended to start the
interface from a location to which the user has write privileges.</p>
<p>From the command line, the <em>redux</em> interface accepts an optional config file
(<em>-c</em>) or log level specification (<em>-l</em>), in the same way the <em>redux_pipe</em>
command does.  Any pipeline parameters provided to the interface in a
configuration file will be used to set default values; they will still be
editable from the GUI.</p>

been completed, its buttons will be grayed out and inaccessible.
It is possible to undo one previous step by clicking <strong>Undo</strong>.
All remaining steps can be run at once by clicking <strong>Reduce</strong>.
After each step, the results of the processing may be displayed
in a data viewer. After running a pipeline step or reduction,
click <strong>Reset</strong> to restore the reduction to the initial state,
without resetting parameter values.</p>
<p>Files can be added to the reduction set (<strong>File -&gt; Add Files</strong>) or

<h4>Display Features<a class="headerlink" href="#display-features" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>The Redux GUI displays images for quality analysis and display (QAD)
in the DS9 FITS viewer.  DS9 is a standalone image display
tool with an extensive feature set.  See the SAO DS9 site
(<a class="reference external" href="http://ds9.si.edu/">http://ds9.si.edu/</a>) for more usage information.</p>
<p>After each pipeline step completes, Redux may load the produced images
into DS9.  Some display options may be customized directly in DS9;
some commonly used options are accessible from the Redux interface, in the
<strong>Data View</strong> tab (<a class="reference internal" href="#fifi-ls-data-view"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 41</span></a>).</p>

<p>From the Redux interface, the <strong>Display Settings</strong> can be used to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Set the FITS extension to display (<strong>First</strong>, or edit to enter
a specific extension), or specify that all extensions should
be displayed in a cube or in separate frames.</p></li>
<li><p>Lock individual frames together, in image or WCS coordinates.</p></li>
<li><p>Lock cube slices for separate frames together, in image or
WCS coordinates.</p></li>
<li><p>Set the image scaling scheme.</p></li>
<li><p>Set a default color map.</p></li>
<li><p>Zoom to fit image after loading.</p></li>
<li><p>Tile image frames, rather than displaying a single frame at a
time.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Changing any of these options in the Data View tab will cause the
currently displayed data to be reloaded, with the new options.
Clicking <strong>Reset Display Settings</strong> will revert any edited options
to the last saved values.  Clicking <strong>Restore Default Display Settings</strong>
will revert all options to their default values.</p>
<p>In the <strong>QAD Tools</strong> section of the <strong>Data View</strong> tab, there are
several additional tools available.</p>
<p>Clicking the <strong>ImExam</strong> button
(scissors icon) launches an event loop in DS9.  After launching it,
bring the DS9 window forward, then use the keyboard to perform interactive
analysis tasks:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Type ‘a’ over a source in the image to perform photometry at the
cursor location.</p></li>
<li><p>Type ‘p’ to plot a pixel-to-pixel comparison of all frames at the
cursor location.</p></li>
<li><p>Type ‘s’ to compute statistics and plot a histogram of the data
at the cursor location.</p></li>
<li><p>Type ‘c’ to clear any previous photometry results or active plots.</p></li>
<li><p>Type ‘h’ to print a help message.</p></li>
<li><p>Type ‘q’ to quit the ImExam loop.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The photometry settings (the image window considered, the model fit,
the aperture sizes, etc.) may be customized in the <strong>Photometry Settings</strong>.
Plot settings (analysis window size, shared plot axes, etc.) may be
customized in the <strong>Plot Settings</strong>.
After modifying these settings, they will take effect only for new
apertures or plots (use ‘c’ to clear old ones first).  As for the display
settings, the reset button will revert to the last saved values
and the restore button will revert to default values.
For the pixel-to-pixel and histogram plots, if the cursor is contained within
a previously defined DS9 region (and the <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">regions</span></code> package is installed),
the plot will consider only pixels within the region.  Otherwise, a window
around the cursor is used to generate the plot data.  Setting the window
to a blank value in the plot settings will use the entire image.</p>
<p>Clicking the <strong>Header</strong> button (magnifying glass icon) from the
<strong>QAD Tools</strong> section opens a new window that displays headers
from currently loaded FITS files in text form (<a class="reference internal" href="#fifi-ls-headers"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 42</span></a>).
The extensions displayed depends on the extension
setting selected (in <strong>Extension to Display</strong>).  If a particular extension is
selected, only that header will be displayed.  If all extensions
are selected (either for cube or multi-frame display), all extension
headers will be displayed.  The buttons at the bottom of the window
may be used to find or filter the header text, or generate a table
of header keywords.  For filter or table display, a comma-separated
list of keys may be entered in the text box.</p>
<p>Clicking the <strong>Save Current Settings</strong> button (disk icon) from the
<strong>QAD Tools</strong> section saves all current display and photometry
settings for the current user.  This allows the user’s settings to
persist across new Redux reductions, and to be loaded when Redux
next starts up.</p>

<h3>FIFI-LS Reduction<a class="headerlink" href="#fifi-ls-reduction" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>FIFI-LS data reduction with Redux follows the data reduction flowchart
given in <a class="reference internal" href="#fifi-flowchart"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 22</span></a>. At each step, Redux attempts to determine
automatically the correct action, given the input data and default
parameters, but each step can be customized as needed.</p>
<p>Some key parameters to note are listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Check Headers</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Abort reduction for invalid headers</em>: By default, Redux will halt the
reduction if the input header keywords do not meet requirements.
Uncheck this box to attempt the reduction anyway.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Fit Ramps</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Signal-to-noise threshold</em>: This value defines the
signal-to-noise cut-off to flag a ramp as bad and ignore it. Set
to -1 to skip the signal-to-noise cut.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Combination threshold (sigma)</em>: This value defines the
rejection threshold for the robust mean combination of the ramp
slopes. Set higher to reject fewer ramps, lower to reject more.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Bad pixel file</em>: By default, the pipeline looks
up a bad pixel mask in <em>fifi-ls/data/badpix_files</em>. To override
the default mask, use this parameter to select a different text
file. The file must be an ASCII table with two columns: the spaxel
number (1-25, numbered left to right in displayed array), and the
spexel number (1-16, numbered bottom to top in displayed array).
This option may be used to block a bad spaxel for a particular
observation, by entering a bad pixel for every spexel index in a
particular spaxel.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Remove 1st 2 ramps</em>: Select to remove the first two ramps. This is
on by default.  This option has no effect if there
are fewer than three ramps per chop.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Subtract bias</em>: If set, the value from the open zeroth
spexel will be subtracted before fitting.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Threshold for grating instability</em>: Threshold in sigma for
allowed ramp-averaged deviation from the expected grating position.
Set to -1 to turn off filtering.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Combine Nods</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Method for combining off-beam images</em>: For C2NC2 only: ‘nearest’
takes the closest B nod in time, ‘average’ will mean-combine before
and after B nods, and ‘interpolate’ will linearly interpolate before
and after B nods to the A nod time.  For OTF mode data, the B nods
are interpolated to the time of each scan position.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Propagate off-beam image instead of on-beam</em>: If selected, B beams
will be treated as if they were A beams for all subsequent
reductions. That is, the map will be produced at the B position
instead of the A. All other filenames and header settings will
remain the same, so use with caution.  This option is mostly
used for testing purposes.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Spatial Calibrate</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Rotate by detector angle</em>: By default, Redux rotates the data by
the detector angle to set North up and East to the left in the
final map. Deselect this box to keep the final map in detector
coordinates.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Flip RA/Dec sign convention (+, -, or default)</em>: For most data, the
sign convention of the DLAM_MAP and DBET_MAP header keywords,
which define the dither offsets, is determined automatically
(parameter value “default”). Occasionally, for particular
observations, these keywords may need their signs flipped,
or used as is (no flip). This is usually determined by inspection of
the results of the Resample step.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Apply Flat</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Skip flat correction</em>: Select this option to skip flat-fielding the
data. This option is mostly used for testing purposes.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Skip flat error propagation</em>: Deselect this option to propagate
the systematic flat correction error in the flux error plane. This
option is not currently recommended: the systematic error is stored
in the CALERR keyword instead.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Combine Scans</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Correct bias offset</em>: Select this option to subtract an
overall bias offset between the individual grating scans.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Telluric Correct</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Skip telluric correction</em>: Select to skip correcting the data for
telluric absorption. This option is mostly used for testing.</p></li>
<li><p><em>ATRAN directory</em>: Use this option to select a directory containing
ATRAN FITS files.  This must be set in order to use water vapor
values for telluric correction.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Cutoff value</em>: Modify to adjust the transmission
fraction below which the telluric-corrected data will be set to NaN.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Use WV values</em>: Select to use water vapor values from the header
(keyword WVZ_OBS) to select the ATRAN file to apply.  This option
will have no effect unless the ATRAN directory is set to a location
containing ATRAN files derived for different PWV values.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Flux Calibrate</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Skip flux calibration</em>: Select to skip flux calibration of the
data. The flux will remain in instrumental units (ADU/sec), with
PROCSTAT=LEVEL_2.  This option is mostly used for testing.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Response file</em>: Use this option to select a FITS
file containing an instrumental response spectrum to use in place
of the default file on disk.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Correct Wave Shift</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Skip wavelength shift correction</em>: Select to skip applying the
correction to the wavelength calibration due to barycentric
velocity. In this case, both telluric-corrected and uncorrected
cubes will be resampled onto the original wavelengths.
This option is mostly used for testing.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Resample</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>General parameters</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Use parallel processing</em>: If not set, data will be processed
serially.  This will likely result in longer processing times,
but smaller memory footprint during processing.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Maximum cores to use</em>: Specify the maximum cores to use, in the
case of parallel processing.  If not specified, the maximum is
the number of available cores, minus 1.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Check memory use during resampling</em>: If set, memory availability
will be checked before processing, and the number of processes will
be modified if necessary.  If not set, processing is attempted with
the maximum number of cores specified.  Use with caution: in some
conditions, unsetting this option may result in software or computer
crashes.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Skip coadd</em>: If selected, a separate flux cube will be made from
each input file, using the interpolation algorithm.
This option is useful for identifying bad input files.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Interpolate instead of fit</em>: If set, an alternate resampling
algorithm will be used, rather than the local polynomial surface
fits. This option may be preferable for data with small dither
offsets; it is not recommended for large maps.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Weight by errors</em>: If set, local fits will be weighted by the
flux errors, as calculated by the pipeline.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Fit rejection threshold (sigma)</em>: If the fit value is more than this
number times the standard deviation away from the weighted mean,
the weighted mean is used instead of the fit value. This parameter
is used to reject bad fit values.  Set to -1 to turn off.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Positive outlier threshold (sigma)</em>: Sets the rejection threshold for the
input data, in sigma.  Set to -1 to turn off.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Negative outlier threshold (sigma)</em>: If non-zero, sets a separate
rejection threshold in sigma for negative fluxes, to be used in a
first-pass rejection.  Set to -1 to turn off.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Append distance weights to output file</em>: If set, distance weights
calculated by the resampling algorithm will be appended to the output
FITS file. This option is primarily used for testing.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Skip computing the uncorrected flux cube</em>: If set, the uncorrected
flux data will be ignored.  This option is primarily for faster
testing and/or quicklook, when the full data product is not required.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Scan resampling parameters</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Use scan reduction before resample</em>: If set, an iterative scan
reduction will be performed to attempt to remove residual correlated
gain and noise before resampling.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Save intermediate scan product</em>: If set, the scan product will be
saved to disk as a FITS file, for diagnostic purposes.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Scan options</em>: Parameters to pass to the scan reduction.
Enter as key=value pairs, space-separated.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Spatial resampling parameters</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Create map in detector coordinates</em>: If set, data are combined in
arsecond offsets from the base position, rather than in sky coordinates.
If not set, detector coordinates are used for nonsidereal targets and
sky coordinates otherwise.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Spatial oversample</em>: This parameter controls the resolution of the output
spatial grid, with reference to the assumed FWHM at the observed wavelength.
The value is given in terms of pixels per reference FWHM for the
detector channel used.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Output spatial pixel size (arcsec)</em>: This parameter directly controls
the resolution of the output spatial grid. If set, this
parameter overrides the spatial oversample parameter. For BLUE data,
the default value is 1.5 arcsec; for RED data, it is 3.0 arcsec.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Spatial surface fit order</em>: This parameter controls the
order of the surface fit to the spatial data at each grid point. Higher
orders give more fine-scale detail, but are more likely to be
unstable. Set to zero to do a weighted mean of the nearby data.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Spatial fit window</em>: This parameter controls how much data to use in the
fit at each grid point. It is given in terms of a factor times the
average spatial FWHM. Higher values will lead to more input data being
considered in the output solution, at the cost of longer processing time.
Too-low values may result in missing data (holes) in the output map.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Spatial smoothing radius</em>: Set to the fraction
of the fit window to use as the radius of the distance-weighting
Gaussian. Lowering this value results in finer detail for the same
input fit window. Too low values may result in noisy output data;
too high values effectively negate the distance weights.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Spatial edge threshold</em>: Specifies the threshold for setting edge
pixels to NaN.  Set lower to block fewer pixels.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Adaptive smoothing algorithm</em>: If ‘scaled’, the size of the smoothing
kernel is allowed to vary, in order to optimize reconstruction of
sharply peaked sources. If ‘shaped’, the kernel shape and rotation
may also vary. If ‘none’, the kernel will not vary.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Spectral resampling parameters</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Spectral oversample</em>: This parameter controls the resolution of the output
spectral grid. The value is given in terms of pixels per reference
spectral FWHM at the central wavelength of the observation.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Output spectral pixel size (um)</em>: This parameter directly controls
the resolution of the output spectral grid.  If set, this
parameter overrides the spatial oversample parameter.  It does not
have a default value.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Spectral surface fit order</em>: This parameter controls the
order of the surface fit to the spectral data at each grid point.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Spectral fit window</em>: This parameter controls how much data to use in the
fit at each wavelength grid point. It is given in terms of a factor times the
average spatial FWHM. Higher values will lead to more input data being
considered in the output solution, at the cost of longer processing time.
Too-low values may result in missing data (holes) in the output map.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Spectral smoothing radius</em>: Set to the fraction
of the fit window to use as the radius of the distance-weighting
Gaussian, in the wavelength dimension.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Spectral edge threshold</em>: Specifies the threshold for setting edge
pixels to NaN, in the wavelength dimension.  Set lower to block
fewer pixels.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Make Spectral Map</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Skip making the preview image</em>: If set, no preview image (PNG file)
will be produced.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Extension to map</em>: Extension name to display in the output image.
This is typically ‘FLUX’ in the first extension, but for some
cubes, ‘UNCORRECTED_FLUX’ may be more appropriate.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Method for selecting spectral slice</em>: May be ‘reference’ or ‘peak’.
If set to ‘reference’, the G_WAVE_B or G_WAVE_R keys are used
to identify the reference wavelength.  The nearest wavelength slice
to the reference wavelength will be used as the spectral slice for the
image.  For the ‘peak’ method, the flux cube
is smoothed by a couple pixels, then the highest S/N voxel is used to
select the spectral slice for the image.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Method for selecting spatial point</em>: May be ‘reference’ or ‘peak’.
If set to ‘reference’, the OBSRA and OBSDEC keys are used
to identify the spatial point for the displayed spectrum.  For the
‘peak’ method, the peak flux in the selected spectral slice is used to
select the spatial point.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Override wavelength slice</em>: Manually specify the
wavelength slice (zero-indexed) for the image.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Override spatial point</em>: Manually specify the
spatial index for the spectrum, as ‘x,y’, zero-indexed.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Fraction of outer wavelengths to ignore</em>: Used with method = ‘peak’.
Set to 0 to include all wavelengths in calculating signal peak.  Set
to a fraction less than 1 to exclude wavelengths at the beginning and
end of the cube.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Color map</em>: Color map for the output PNG image.  Any valid Matplotlib
name may be specified.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Flux scale for image</em>: A low and high percentile value , used for
scaling the spectral image, e.g. [0,99].</p></li>
<li><p><em>Number of contours</em>: Number of contour levels to be over-plotted on
the image.  Set to 0 to turn off contours.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Contour color</em>: Color for the contour lines.  Any valid Matplotlib
color name may be specified.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Filled contours</em>: If set, contours will be filled instead of overlaid.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Overlay grid</em>: If set, a coordinate grid will be overlaid.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Beam marker</em>: If set, a beam marker will be added to the plot.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Overplot transmission</em>: If set, the atmospheric transmission spectrum
will be displayed in the spectral plot.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Flux scale for spectral plot</em>: Specify a low and high percentile value
for the spectral flux scale, e.g. [0,99].  If set to [0, 100],
Matplotlib defaults are used.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Watermark text</em>: If set to a non-empty string, the text will be
added to the lower-right of the image as a semi-transparent watermark.</p></li>

<h2>Data quality assessment<a class="headerlink" href="#data-quality-assessment" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>After the pipeline has been run on a set of input data, the output
products should be checked to ensure that the data has been properly
reduced.  Data quality and quirks can vary widely across individual
observations, but the following general guideline gives some strategies
for approaching quality assessment for FIFI-LS data.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Check the output to the log file (usually called
<em>redux_[date]_[time].log</em>), written to the same directory as the
output files. Look for messages marked ERROR or WARNING. The log will
also list every parameter used in the pipeline steps, which may help
disambiguate the parameters as actually-run for the pipeline.</p></li>
<li><p>Check that the expected files were written to disk: there should, at
a minimum, be a scan-combined file (<em>SCM</em>), a flux-calibrated file
(<em>CAL</em>), and a resampled file (<em>WXY</em>).</p></li>
<li><p>Look at each plane of the reduced image in the <em>WXY</em> file. Check that
the resampling seems to have completed successfully: there
should not be excessive holes in the map, or bad pixels away from the
edges of the image. If there are, the spatial resampling may need to
be redone with modified parameters.</p></li>
<li><p>Look at the spectra for a sampling of spatial pixels in the <em>WXY</em>
file. Check that there are no sudden dropouts or other
discontinuities in the spectrum that are not associated with poor
atmospheric transmission. If there are such discontinuities, the
wavelength resampling may need to be redone with modified parameters.</p></li>
