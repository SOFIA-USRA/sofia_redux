ATRAN data directory
====================

This directory contains data files for atmospheric correction.

Note that this distribution contains a minimal reference set, to
keep the package size small. 

Full libraries of ATRAN files for FLITECAM may be downloaded from the
`SOFIA website <https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/SOFIA/docs/data/data-pipelines/>`__.
