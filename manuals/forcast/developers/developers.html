<h3>Document Purpose<a class="headerlink" href="#document-purpose" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>This document is intended to provide all the information necessary to
maintain the FORCAST Redux pipeline, used to produce
Level 2, 3, and 4 reduced products for FORCAST imaging and grism data, in
either manual or automatic mode. Level 2 is defined as data that has
been processed to correct for instrumental effects; Level 3 is defined
as flux-calibrated data; Level 4 is any higher data product.
A more general introduction to the data
reduction procedure and the scientific justification of the algorithms
is available in the FORCAST Redux User’s Manual.</p>
<p>This manual applies to FORCAST Redux version 2.7.0.</p>

<section id="redux-revision-history">
<h3>Redux Revision History<a class="headerlink" href="#redux-revision-history" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>FORCAST Redux was developed as five separate software packages: DRIP,
which provides the FORCAST-specific processing algorithms; PypeUtils,
which provides general-purpose scientific algorithms; PySpextool, which
provides spectroscopic data reduction algorithms; PypeCal, which provides
photometry and flux calibration algorithms; and Redux,
which provides the interactive GUI, the automatic pipeline wrapper,
and the supporting structure to call the FORCAST algorithms.</p>
<p>DRIP is a Python translation of an IDL package developed
in IDL by Dr. Luke Keller and Dr. Marc Berthoud for the
reduction of FORCAST data. Version 1.0.0 was originally released for use
at SOFIA in July 2013. DRIP originally contained a set of imaging
reduction functions, an object-oriented structure for calling these
functions, an automatic pipeline, and an interactive GUI for manual
reductions. The package also supported spectroscopic reductions with an
interface developed in parallel to the DRIP interface, called FG
(FORCAST Grism). DRIP v2.0.0 was developed in 2019 and 2020, by Daniel
Perera and Melanie Clarke, as a full reimplementation in Python.
This version translates only the imaging algorithms from DRIP,
replacing the other functionality with PySpextool algorithms and Redux
structures.</p>
<p>PypeUtils was developed as a shared code base for SOFIA Python pipelines,
primarily by Daniel Perera for USRA/SOFIA.  It contains any algorithms
or utilities likely to be of general use for data reduction pipelines.
From this package, the FORCAST pipeline uses some FITS handling utilities,
multiprocessing tools, image manipulation algorithms,
and interpolation and resampling functions.</p>
<p>Like DRIP, PySpextool is a translation of an earlier SOFIA IDL library,
called FSpextool.  FSpextool was built on top of a pre-release version of
Spextool 4, an IDL-based package developed by Dr. Michael Cushing and Dr.
William Vacca for the reduction of data from the SpeX instrument on the
NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF). Spextool was originally released in
October 2000, and has undergone a number of major and minor revisions since
then. The last stable public release was v4.1, released January 2016. As
Spextool does not natively support automatic command-line processing,
FSpextool for SOFIA adapted the Spextool library to the SOFIA architecture
and instruments; version 1.0.0 was originally released for use at SOFIA
in July 2013. PySpextool is a Python translation of the core algorithms in
this package, developed by Daniel Perera and Melanie Clarke, and first
released at SOFIA for use in the FIFI-LS pipeline in October 2019.</p>
<p>PypeCal is a Python translation of the IDL PipeCal package,
developed by the SOFIA DPS team, to provide photometry and flux calibration
algorithms that may be used to calibrate imaging data from any instrument,
given appropriate reference data. It was originally developed by Dr. Miguel
Charcos-Llorens and Dr. William Vacca as a set of IDL and shell scripts that
were run independently of the Level 2 pipeline, then was refactored by Melanie
Clarke for incorporation into the Redux pipeline. It was first
incorporated into FORCAST Redux in version 1.0.4, which was released for
use in May 2015.  PypeCal is a full translation of this package, developed
by Dr. Rachel Vander Vliet and Melanie Clarke, and first
released for use at SOFIA with the HAWC+ pipeline in February 2019.</p>
<p>Redux was originally developed to be a general-purpose interface to IDL data
reduction algorithms. It provided an interactive GUI and an
object-oriented structure for calling data reduction processes, but it
did not provide its own data reduction algorithms. It was developed by
Melanie Clarke, for the SOFIA DPS team, to provide a consistent
front-end to the data reduction pipelines for multiple instruments and
modes, including FORCAST.  It was redesigned and reimplemented in Python,
with similar functionality, to support Python pipelines for SOFIA.  The
first release of the IDL version was in December 2013; the Python version
was first released to support the HAWC+ pipeline in September 2018.</p>
<p>In 2020, all SOFIA pipeline packages were unified into a single package,
called <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sofia_redux</span></code>.  The interface package (Redux) was renamed to
<code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sofia_redux.pipeline</span></code>, PypeUtils was renamed to <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sofia_redux.toolkit</span></code>,
PypeCal was renamed to <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sofia_redux.calibration</span></code>,
PySpextool was renamed to <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sofia_redux.spectroscopy</span></code>, and the DRIP
package was renamed to <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sofia_redux.instruments.forcast</span></code>.  An additional
package, to support data visualization, was added as
<code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sofia_redux.visualization</span></code>.</p>

<h2>Overview of Software Structure<a class="headerlink" href="#overview-of-software-structure" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The sofia_redux package has several sub-modules organized by functionality:</p>

├── calibration
├── instruments
│   ├── exes

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The modules used in the FORCAST pipeline are described below.</p>
<section id="sofia-redux-instruments-forcast">
<h3>sofia_redux.instruments.forcast<a class="headerlink" href="#sofia-redux-instruments-forcast" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sofia_redux.instruments.forcast</span></code> package is written in Python using
standard scientific tools and libraries.</p>
<p>The data reduction algorithms used by the pipeline are straight-forward
functions that generally take a data array, corresponding to a single
image file, as an argument and return the processed image array as a result.
They generally also take as secondary input a variance array to process
alongside the image, a header array to track metadata, and keyword
parameters to specify non-default settings. Parameters for these functions
may also be provided via a configuration file packaged along with the
software (<em>dripconf.txt</em>) that gets read into a global variable.
Redux manipulates this global variable as necessary in order to provide
non-default parameters to the data processing functions.</p>
<p>The <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">forcast</span></code> module also stores any reference data needed by the FORCAST
pipeline, in either imaging or grism mode.  This includes bad pixel masks,
nonlinearity coefficients, pinhole masks for imaging distortion correction,
wavelength calibration files, atmospheric transmission spectra, spectral
standard models, and instrument response spectra.  The default files may
vary by date; these defaults are managed by the <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">getcalpath</span></code> function
in the <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">forcast</span></code> module.  New date configurations may be added to the
caldefault.txt files in <em>forcast/data/caldefault.txt</em> and
<em>forcast/data/grism/caldefault.txt</em>.</p>

<section id="sofia-redux-toolkit">
<h3>sofia_redux.toolkit<a class="headerlink" href="#sofia-redux-toolkit" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p><code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sofia_redux.toolkit</span></code> is a repository for classes and functions of general usefulness,
intended to support multiple SOFIA pipelines.  It contains several submodules,
for interpolation, image manipulation, multiprocessing support, numerical calculations, and
FITS handling.  Most utilities are simple functions that take input
as arguments and return output values.  Some more complicated functionality
is implemented in several related classes; see the <a class="reference internal" href="../../../sofia_redux/toolkit/index.html#module-sofia_redux.toolkit.resampling" title="sofia_redux.toolkit.resampling"><code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sofia_redux.toolkit.resampling</span></code></a>

<section id="sofia-redux-spectroscopy">
<h3>sofia_redux.spectroscopy<a class="headerlink" href="#sofia-redux-spectroscopy" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sofia_redux.spectroscopy</span></code> package contains a library of general-purpose
spectroscopic functions.  The FORCAST pipeline uses these algorithms
for spectroscopic image rectification, aperture identification, and
spectral extraction and calibration. Most of these algorithms are simple
functions that take spectroscopic data as input and return processed data
as output.  However, the input and output values may be more complex than the
image processing algorithms in the <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">forcast</span></code> package.  The Redux interface
in the <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pipeline</span></code> package manages the input and output requirements for
FORCAST data and calls each function individually.  See the
<code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sofia_redux.spectroscopy</span></code> API documentation for more information.</p>
</section>
<section id="sofia-redux-calibration">
<h3>sofia_redux.calibration<a class="headerlink" href="#sofia-redux-calibration" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sofia_redux.calibration</span></code> package contains flux calibration algorithms
used by Redux perform photometric or flux calibration calculations on
input images and return their results. The complexity of this package is
primarily in the organization of the reference data contained in the
<em>data</em> directory. This directory contains a set of calibration data for
each supported instrument (currently FORCAST and HAWC+). For each
instrument, the configuration files are split into groups based on how
often they are expected to change, as follows.</p>
<p>In the <em>filter_def</em> directory, there is a file that defines the
mean/reference wavelength, pivot wavelength, and color leak correction
factor for each filter name (SPECTEL). This may vary by date only if the
filters change, but keep the same SPECTEL name. The color leak factor is
currently 1.0 for all filters (no color correction).</p>
<p>In the <em>response</em> directory, there are response fit files that define
the fit coefficients for each filter, with a separate file for the
altitude fit, airmass fit, and PWV fit for each of single/dual modes.
These should also change rarely.</p>
<p>In the <em>ref_calfctr</em> directory, there are files that define the average
reference calibration factors to apply to science objects, by filter,
along with the associated error value. It is expected that there will be
a different ref_calfctr file for each flight series, produced by an
analysis of all standards taken throughout the flight series.</p>
<p>In the <em>standard_flux</em> directory, there is a file that defines the flux
model characteristics for each object: the percent error on the model,
and the scale factor to apply to the model. The model error is 5% for
all stars except BetaPeg (which is 9.43%), and is 20% for all asteroids.
The scale factor is usually 1.0, with the exception of BetaUmi, which
requires scaling by 1.18 from the model output files. This file should
change rarely, if ever, except to add objects to it. Currently, the same
file is used for all data. Also in the <em>standard flux</em> directory, there
are output files from the standard models for each object, for each
applicable date if necessary. From these files, the lambda_mean column
is read and compared to the mean wavelength in the filter_def file. If
found, the corresponding value in the Fnu_mean column is used as the
standard model flux. If there is a scale defined in the model_err file,
it is applied to the flux value. These files should rarely change, but
new ones will be added for asteroids any time they are observed. They
may need to be redone if the filter wavelengths change.</p>
<p>To manage all these files, there is a top-level calibration
configuration file (<em>caldefault.txt</em>), which contains the filenames for
the filter definition file, the model error file, the reference cal
factor file, and the response fit files, organized by date and filter.
This table will most likely be updated once per series, when we have
generated the reference calibration factors. There is also a standards
configuration file (<em>stddefault.txt</em>) that identifies the model flux
file to use by date and mode (single/dual). For stars, the date is set
to 99999999, meaning that the models can be used for any date; asteroids
may have multiple entries - one for each date they are observed. This
file must be updated whenever there are new asteroid flux models to add,
but it should be as simple as dropping the model file in the right
directory and adding a line to the table to identify it.</p>

<section id="design">
<h4>Design<a class="headerlink" href="#design" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Redux is designed to be a light-weight interface to data reduction
pipelines.  It contains the definitions of how reduction algorithms
should be called for any given instrument, mode, or pipeline,
in either a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user
interface (GUI) mode, but it does not contain the reduction
algorithms themselves.</p>
<p>Redux is organized around the principle that
any data reduction procedure can be accomplished by running a linear
sequence of data reduction steps. It relies on a <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Reduction</span></code> class that
defines what these steps are and in which order they should be run
(the reduction “recipe”).  Reductions have an associated <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Parameter</span></code>
class that defines what parameters the steps may accept.  Because
reduction classes share common interaction methods, they can be
instantiated and called from a completely generic front-end GUI,
which provides the capability to load in raw data files, and then:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>set the parameters for a reduction step,</p></li>
<li><p>run the step on all input data,</p></li>
<li><p>display the results of the processing,</p></li>
</ol>
<p>and repeat this process for every step in sequence to complete the
reduction on the loaded data. In order to choose the correct
reduction object for a given data set, the interface uses a <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Chooser</span></code>
class, which reads header information from loaded input files and
uses it to decide which reduction object to instantiate and return.</p>
<p>The GUI is a PyQt  application, based around the <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Application</span></code>
class. Because the GUI operations are completely separate from the
reduction operations, the automatic pipeline script is simply a wrapper
around a reduction object: the <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Pipe</span></code> class uses the Chooser to
instantiate the Reduction, then calls its <em>reduce</em> method, which calls
each reduction step in order and reports any output files generated.
Both the Application and Pipe classes inherit from a common <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Interface</span></code>
class that holds reduction objects and defines the methods for
interacting with them.  The <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Application</span></code> class additionally may
start and update custom data viewers associated with the
data reduction; these should inherit from the Redux <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Viewer</span></code> class.</p>
<p>All reduction classes inherit from the generic <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Reduction</span></code> class,
which defines the common interface for all reductions: how parameters
are initialized and modified, how each step is called.
Each specific reduction class must then define
each data reduction step as a method that calls the appropriate
algorithm.</p>
<p>The reduction methods may contain any code necessary to
accomplish the data reduction step. Typically, a reduction method will
contain code to fetch the parameters for the method from the object’s
associated Parameters class, then will
call an external data reduction algorithm with appropriate parameter values,
and store the results in the ‘input’ attribute to be available for the
next processing step. If processing results in data that can be displayed,
it should be placed in the ‘display_data’ attribute, in a format that
can be recognized by the associated Viewers.  The Redux GUI checks
this attribute at the end of each data reduction step and displays the
contents via the Viewer’s ‘display’ method.</p>
<p>Parameters for data reduction are stored as a list of <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ParameterSet</span></code>
objects, one for each reduction step.  Parameter sets contain the key,
value, data type, and widget type information for every parameter.
A <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Parameters</span></code> class may generate these parameter sets by
defining a default dictionary that associates step names with parameter
lists that define these values.  This dictionary may be defined directly
in the Parameters class, or may be read in from an external configuration
file or software package, as appropriate for the reduction.</p>

<p>The recipe attribute for the reduction class specifies the above steps,
in the order given, with general FORCAST algorithms preceding the
imaging or spectroscopy ones.</p>
<p>If an intermediate file is loaded, its product type is
identified from the PRODTYPE keyword in its header, and the prodtype_map
attribute is used to identify the next step in the recipe.  This
allows reductions to be picked up at any point, from a saved intermediate
file.  For more information on the scientific goals and methods used in
each step, see the FORCAST Redux User’s Manual.</p>
<p>The FORCAST reduction classes also contains several helper functions, that
assist in reading and writing files on disk, and identifying which
data to display in the interactive GUI.  Display is performed via
the <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">QADViewer</span></code> class provided by the Redux package.  Spectroscopic diagnostic
data is additionally displayed by the <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MatplotlibViewer</span></code> class.</p>

<p>There are also three additional reduction classes used for special purposes:
<code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">FORCASTWavecalReduction</span></code>, <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">FORCASTSpatcalReduction</span></code>, and
<code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">FORCASTSlitcorrReduction</span></code>.  These classes inherit from
<code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">FORCASTSpectroscopyReduction</span></code>, but customize the reduction
steps to produce reference wavelength, spatial, and slit correction
calibration files, respectively, for use within the standard FORCAST
spectroscopy pipeline.</p>
