<h3>Document Purpose<a class="headerlink" href="#document-purpose" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>This document is intended to provide all the information necessary to
maintain the FIFI-LS Redux pipeline, used to produce
Level 2, 3, and 4 reduced products for FIFI-LS data, in either manual or
automatic mode. Level 2 is defined as data that has been processed to
correct for instrumental effects; Level 3 is defined as data that has
been flux-calibrated; Level 4 is any higher data product. A more general
introduction to the data reduction procedure and the scientific justification
of the algorithms is available in the FIFI-LS Redux User’s Manual.</p>
<p>This manual applies to FIFI-LS Redux version 2.7.0.</p>

<section id="redux-revision-history">
<h3>Redux Revision History<a class="headerlink" href="#redux-revision-history" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>FIFI-LS Redux was developed as four separate reduction packages: PyFIFI,
which provides the data processing algorithms; PypeUtils,
which provides general-purpose scientific algorithms; PySpextool, which
provides some supporting libraries for spectroscopic data reduction; and Redux,
which provides the interactive GUI, the automatic pipeline wrapper,
and the supporting structure to call the FIFI-LS algorithms.</p>
<p>PyFIFI is a Python translation of an IDL package developed for the reduction of
FIFI-LS data. Dr. Kaori Nishikida and Dr. Randolf Klein initially
developed a prototype of the algorithms, around 2004. Development in IDL was
picked up in February 2015 by Jennifer Holt and Dr. William Vacca for
USRA/SOFIA, with reference to a separate FIFI-LS pipeline, developed in
LabView by Rainer Hoenle. Integration into the Redux interface
and completion of the reduction algorithms was undertaken by
Melanie Clarke and Dr. William Vacca in September 2015. Version 1.0.0 of
the package was released for use at SOFIA in November 2015. Version 2.0.0 of
the package was entirely reimplemented in Python, primarily by Daniel Perera,
with support and integration by Melanie Clarke.</p>
<p>PypeUtils was developed as a shared code base for SOFIA Python pipelines,
primarily by Daniel Perera for USRA/SOFIA.  It contains any algorithms
or utilities likely to be of general use for data reduction pipelines.
From this package, the FIFI-LS pipeline uses some FITS handling utilities,
multiprocessing tools, and interpolation and resampling functions.</p>
<p>Like PyFIFI, PySpextool is a translation of an earlier SOFIA IDL library,
called FSpextool.  FSpextool was built on top of a pre-release version of
Spextool 4, an IDL-based package developed by Dr. Michael Cushing and Dr.
William Vacca for the reduction of data from the SpeX instrument on the
NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF). Spextool was originally released in
October 2000, and has undergone a number of major and minor revisions since
then. The last stable public release was v4.1, released January 2016. As
Spextool does not natively support automatic command-line processing,
FSpextool for SOFIA adapted the Spextool library to the SOFIA architecture
and instruments; version 1.0.0 was originally released for use at SOFIA
in July 2013. PySpextool is a Python translation of the core algorithms in
this package, developed by Daniel Perera and Melanie Clarke, and first
released at SOFIA for use in the FIFI-LS pipeline in October 2019.</p>
<p>Redux was originally developed to be a general-purpose interface to IDL data
reduction algorithms. It provided an interactive GUI and an
object-oriented structure for calling data reduction processes, but it
did not provide its own data reduction algorithms. It was developed by
Melanie Clarke, for the SOFIA DPS team, to provide a consistent
front-end to the data reduction pipelines for multiple instruments and
modes, including FIFI-LS.  It was redesigned and reimplemented in Python,
with similar functionality, to support Python pipelines for SOFIA.  The
first release of the IDL version was in December 2013; the Python version
was first released to support the HAWC+ pipeline in September 2018.</p>
<p>In 2020, all SOFIA pipeline packages were unified into a single package,
called <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sofia_redux</span></code>.  The interface package (Redux) was renamed to
<code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sofia_redux.pipeline</span></code>, PypeUtils was renamed to <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sofia_redux.toolkit</span></code>,
PySpextool was renamed to <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sofia_redux.spectroscopy</span></code>, and the PyFIFI
package was renamed to <a class="reference internal" href="../../../sofia_redux/instruments/fifi_ls/index.html#module-sofia_redux.instruments.fifi_ls" title="sofia_redux.instruments.fifi_ls"><code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sofia_redux.instruments.fifi_ls</span></code></a>.  An additional
package, to support data visualization, was added as
<code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sofia_redux.visualization</span></code>.</p>
<p>In 2021 and 2022, additional optional features from the <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sofia_redux</span></code>
package were incorporated into the FIFI-LS pipeline.  The interface provides
some interactive photometry routines via <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sofia_redux.calibration</span></code> and
some additional support for on-the-fly mode data via <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sofia_redux.scan</span></code>.</p>

<h4>Design<a class="headerlink" href="#design" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Redux is designed to be a light-weight interface to data reduction
pipelines.  It contains the definitions of how reduction algorithms
should be called for any given instrument, mode, or pipeline,
in either a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user
interface (GUI) mode, but it does not contain the reduction
algorithms themselves.</p>
<p>Redux is organized around the principle that
any data reduction procedure can be accomplished by running a linear
sequence of data reduction steps. It relies on a <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Reduction</span></code> class that
defines what these steps are and in which order they should be run
(the reduction “recipe”).  Reductions have an associated <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Parameter</span></code>
class that defines what parameters the steps may accept.  Because
reduction classes share common interaction methods, they can be
instantiated and called from a completely generic front-end GUI,
which provides the capability to load in raw data files, and then:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>set the parameters for a reduction step,</p></li>
<li><p>run the step on all input data,</p></li>
<li><p>display the results of the processing,</p></li>
</ol>
<p>and repeat this process for every step in sequence to complete the
reduction on the loaded data. In order to choose the correct
reduction object for a given data set, the interface uses a <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Chooser</span></code>
class, which reads header information from loaded input files and
uses it to decide which reduction object to instantiate and return.</p>
<p>The GUI is a PyQt  application, based around the <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Application</span></code>
class. Because the GUI operations are completely separate from the
reduction operations, the automatic pipeline script is simply a wrapper
around a reduction object: the <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Pipe</span></code> class uses the Chooser to
instantiate the Reduction, then calls its <em>reduce</em> method, which calls
each reduction step in order and reports any output files generated.
Both the Application and Pipe classes inherit from a common <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Interface</span></code>
class that holds reduction objects and defines the methods for
interacting with them.  The <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Application</span></code> class additionally may
start and update custom data viewers associated with the
data reduction; these should inherit from the Redux <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Viewer</span></code> class.</p>
<p>All reduction classes inherit from the generic <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Reduction</span></code> class,
which defines the common interface for all reductions: how parameters
are initialized and modified, how each step is called.
Each specific reduction class must then define
each data reduction step as a method that calls the appropriate
algorithm.</p>
<p>The reduction methods may contain any code necessary to
accomplish the data reduction step. Typically, a reduction method will
contain code to fetch the parameters for the method from the object’s
associated Parameters class, then will
call an external data reduction algorithm with appropriate parameter values,
and store the results in the ‘input’ attribute to be available for the
next processing step. If processing results in data that can be displayed,
it should be placed in the ‘display_data’ attribute, in a format that
can be recognized by the associated Viewers.  The Redux GUI checks
this attribute at the end of each data reduction step and displays the
contents via the Viewer’s ‘display’ method.</p>
<p>Parameters for data reduction are stored as a list of <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ParameterSet</span></code>
objects, one for each reduction step.  Parameter sets contain the key,
value, data type, and widget type information for every parameter.
A <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Parameters</span></code> class may generate these parameter sets by
defining a default dictionary that associates step names with parameter
lists that define these values.  This dictionary may be defined directly
in the Parameters class, or may be read in from an external configuration
file or software package, as appropriate for the reduction.</p>

<h4>FIFI-LS Redux<a class="headerlink" href="#fifi-ls-redux" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>To interface to the FIFI-LS pipeline algorithms, Redux defines
the <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">FIFILSReduction</span></code> and <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">FIFILSParameters</span></code> classes.

<p>The recipe attribute for the reduction class specifies the above steps,
in that order.  Most FIFI-LS steps provide a wrapper function that
allows processing to proceed in parallel, if desired, when called on a
list of input files.  The FIFILSReduction interface uses these wrapper functions
where appropriate, and the FIFILSParameters class defines the defaults
for the parallel processing capabilities.</p>
<p>If an intermediate file is loaded, its product type is
identified from the PRODTYPE keyword in its header, and the prodtype_map
attribute is used to identify the next step in the recipe.  This
allows reductions to be picked up at any point, from a saved intermediate
file.  For more information on the scientific goals and methods used in
each step, see the FIFI-LS Redux User’s Manual.</p>
<p>The FIFILSReduction class also contains several helper functions, that
assist in reading and writing files on disk, and identifying which
data to display in the interactive GUI.  Display is performed via
the <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">QADViewer</span></code> class provided by the Redux package.</p>
