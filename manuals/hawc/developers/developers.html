<h3>Document Purpose<a class="headerlink" href="#document-purpose" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>This document is intended to provide all the information necessary to
maintain the HAWC+ DRP pipeline, used to produce Level
2, 3, and 4 reduced products for HAWC+ data, in either manual or automatic
mode. Level 2 is defined as data that has been processed to correct for
instrumental effects; Level 3 is defined as data that has been
flux-calibrated. Level 4 is any higher-level data product. A more
general introduction to the data reduction procedure and the scientific
justification of the algorithms is available in the HAWC+ DRP Users
Manual.</p>
<p>This manual applies to HAWC+ DRP version 3.2.0.</p>

<h3>HAWC DRP Revision History<a class="headerlink" href="#hawc-drp-revision-history" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The HAWC pipeline was originally developed as three separate packages: the
HAWC Data Reduction Pipeline (DRP), which contains pipeline infrastructure and
chop/nod imaging and polarimetry reduction algorithms; the
Comprehensive Reduction Utility for SHARC-2 (CRUSH), which contained
scan-mode data reduction algorithms; and Redux, which provides
the interface to the pipeline algorithms for command-line and interactive
use.</p>
<p>The HAWC DRP was developed by the HAWC+ team at Northwestern University
and University of Chicago, principally Dr. Marc Berthoud, Dr. Fabio
Santos, and Dr. Nicholas Chapman, under the direction of the HAWC+
Principal Investigator, Dr. C. Darren Dowell, and the software lead, Dr.
Giles Novak. The DRP infrastructure has roots in an earlier data
reduction pipeline, built for SOFIA’s FORCAST instrument, while many of
the scientific algorithms were originally developed for SHARC-2/SHARP,
the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory’s imaging polarimeter.</p>
<p>CRUSH began as a PhD project at Caltech to support data reduction for
the SHARC-2 instrument, but has since been expanded to support data
reduction for many other instruments. It was originally developed and
maintained by Dr. Attila Kovács.</p>
<p>The SOFIA Data Processing Systems (DPS) team provided the Redux interface
package and develops, maintains, integrates, and releases the HAWC pipeline.
DPS first released the pipeline for SOFIA data reductions
in January 2017.  Starting January 2019, the DPS also maintained a local
fork of the CRUSH pipeline, for further development and support of the
scan-mode algorithms.  In addition, as of HAWC DRP v2.1.0, some calibration and general
data reduction utilities were moved to packages shared by other SOFIA
pipelines (<code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sofia_redux.calibration</span></code> and <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sofia_redux.toolkit</span></code>, respectively).</p>
<p>In 2020, all SOFIA pipeline packages were unified into a single package,
called <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sofia_redux</span></code>.  The interface package (Redux) was renamed to
<code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sofia_redux.pipeline</span></code>, and the HAWC DRP package was renamed to
<code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sofia_redux.instruments.hawc</span></code>.</p>
<p>In 2022, the Java implementation of the CRUSH pipeline was replaced by
a Python implementation in the SOFIA Redux package, at <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sofia_redux.scan</span></code>.</p>

<h3>DRP Architecture<a class="headerlink" href="#drp-architecture" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The HAWC DRP (<code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sofia_redux.instruments.hawc</span></code>) package is written in Python using
standard scientific tools and libraries. It has two main structures: data
containers and the data processing algorithms (pipe steps).</p>
<p>In the DRP, data reduction proceeds by creating and calling
pipeline Step objects, each of which is responsible for a single step
in the data reduction. Pipe steps (e.g. StepPrepare, StepDemodulate, etc.)
inherit from StepParent objects that
define how a step is executed on its inputs, and how its outputs are
returned. Input and output data are stored and exchanged in Data
objects. Typically, these Data objects contain the equivalent of a FITS
file (DataFits), with a header structure and binary data arranged into
header-data units (HDUs), but may optionally correspond to a text file
(DataText) or other format. All pipeline components use a common
configuration object and send messages to common logger objects. See
<a class="reference internal" href="#drp-objects"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 116</span></a> for a class diagram of the relationships
between the most important DRP classes.</p>

<p><span class="caption-number">Fig. 116 </span><span class="caption-text">DRP Core Class Diagram. Pipeline steps inherit from StepParent (for
single-input, single-output steps), StepMIParent (for multi-input,
single-output steps) or from StepMOParent (for multi-input,
multi-output steps). Input and output data for the steps may be any
object that inherits from DataParent, but are typically DataFits
objects.</span><a class="headerlink" href="#drp-objects" title="Link to this image">¶</a></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<section id="data-objects">
<h4>Data Objects<a class="headerlink" href="#data-objects" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>The pipeline data objects, which inherit from DataParent, store raw,
partly-reduced, or fully-reduced data. This structure is used for both
the FITS files saved to disk as well as the data in memory that is
passed between pipeline steps. The most commonly used object, DataFits,
stores data as astropy.io.fits header-data units (HDUs). It can load,
copy, or store image HDUs or binary table HDUs, in addition to the
primary HDU. The primary extension typically contains the image data
that is most important to the user. All secondary images and tables
store additional information (noise, exposure maps, bad pixel maps,
etc.), each with a unique EXTNAME stored in their associated headers.
Images may be accessed with the <em>DataFits.imageget()</em>,
<em>DataFits.imageset()</em>, and <em>DataFits.imagedel()</em> methods. Tables can be
accessed with <em>DataFits.tableget()</em>, <em>DataFits.tableset()</em>, and
<em>DataFits.tabledel()</em> methods. DataFits also has table manipulation
methods that can be used to modify a table extension in place
(<em>DataFits.tableaddcol()</em>, <em>DataFits.tablemergerows()</em>, etc.).</p>
<p>The primary header typically contains the same keywords as the raw input
data. In addition, each pipeline step adds a HISTORY keyword to the FITS
header and updates the PRODNAME, PROCSTAT, and PIPEVERS keywords. When
input files are merged in multi-input, single-output steps, most
keywords are taken from the first input header, but some keywords may
require special handling (averaging, concatenation, or other operations
across the input set). These special merge handling procedures are
specified in the DRP configuration file, in the [headmerge] section, and
are handled by the <em>DataFits.mergehead()</em> method.</p>
<p>Header keywords may also be overridden in the configuration file, in the
[header] section. When the <em>DataFits.getheadval()</em> method is called, it
first checks the configuration file for a keyword in this section. If it
is found, it is used instead of the value from the stored header. For
this reason, it is recommended to retrieve all FITS keywords with the
<em>getheadval</em> method, rather than accessing <em>DataFits.header</em> directly.
FITS keywords should also be set with the <em>setheadval</em> method.</p>
<p>Pipeline data objects also store their own file names. Pipeline steps
update the file name in the object before returning them as output,
using the <em>filenamebegin</em>, <em>filenameend</em>, and <em>filenum</em> keywords in the
[data] section of the configuration file to determine how to insert the
product type (a three-letter identifier, different for each pipeline
step) and compose a new output name. The file name segments for any data
object can be accessed by calling <em>DataFits.filename</em> for the full name
(including path), <em>DataFits.filenamebegin</em> for all parts of the name up
to the product type, <em>DataFits.filenameend</em> for all parts of the name
after the product type, and <em>DataFits.filenum</em> for the file number
embedded in the file name.</p>
<p>Pipeline data objects also store a configuration object in ConfigObj
format and a logging object for passing messages to. See
<a class="reference internal" href="#drp-data-class"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 117</span></a> for brief documentation of the most important
attributes and operations of the DataFits object.</p>

<section id="pipeline-steps">
<h4>Pipeline Steps<a class="headerlink" href="#pipeline-steps" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>The pipeline step objects contain the main function for a single data
reduction algorithm, along with its associated parameters. Each step
object is directly callable as, for example,</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>intermediate = StepOne(input)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>where <em>input</em> is generally a list of DataFits objects containing the
data to operate on, and <em>intermediate</em> is a list of output DataFits
objects, on which the operation has been performed.</p>
<p>All pipeline steps inherit from a common parent object (StepParent) or
one of its children (StepMIParent, StepMOParent). Most pipe steps are
single-input, single-output (SISO) steps, which inherit directly from
StepParent. That is, they take a single Data object as input and return
a single Data object as output. They may be called in a loop to process
a series of files at once. Some steps may implement algorithms that
operate on a list of Data objects and return a single Data object as
output (multi-input, single output; MISO). These inherit from
StepMIParent. Some steps may also operate on a list of Data objects at
once, but still return multiple output files (multi-input, multi-output;
MIMO). These inherit from StepMOParent. See <a class="reference internal" href="#drp-step-class"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 118</span></a>
for a diagram of the Step parent classes.</p>
<p>Parameters for each step are generally defined in their <em>setup</em> method.
Each parameter is a list containing the parameter name, default value,
and a comment. Parameters for the step are stored in a list in the
<em>paramlist</em> attribute, and may be retrieved by calling the
<em>StepParent.getarg()</em> method. This method first checks for a value in a
configuration file; if not found, the default value will be used.</p>

<h5>Main Classes<a class="headerlink" href="#main-classes" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h5>
<p>The primary data structures for modeling an instrument in the scan package
are listed below, and their relationships are diagrammed in
<a class="reference internal" href="../../../sofia_redux/scan/scan_architecture.html#scan-data"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 131</span></a>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>ChannelData</strong>: an class representing a set of detector channel (pixels).
A channel has properties, such as gains, flags, and weights etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ChannelGroup</strong>: A generic grouping of detector channels.  This is
implemented as a wrapper around the <em>ChannelData</em> class, with access
to specific channel indices held by the underlying arrays.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Channels</strong>: An class representing all the available channels for
an instrument.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Frames</strong>: A data structure that represents the readout values of all
<em>Channels</em> at a given time sample, together with software flags, and
associated properties (e.g. gain, transmission, weight etc.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Integration</strong>: A collection of <em>Frames</em> that comprises a contiguous
dataset, for which one can assume overall stability of gains and
noise properties. Typically an <em>Integration</em> is a few minutes of data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan</strong>: A collection of <em>Integrations</em> that comprise a single file
or observing entity. For HAWC+, a scan is a data file, and by default
each scan contains just one integration. However, it is possible to break
<em>Scans</em> into multiple <em>Integrations</em>, if desired.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Signal</strong>: An object representing some time-variant scalar signal
that may (or may not) produce a response in the detector channels.
For example, the chopper motion in the ‘x’ direction is such a
<em>Signal</em> (available as ‘chopper-x’) that may be used during the
reduction.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dependents</strong>: An object that keeps track of the number of model
parameters derived from each <em>Frame</em> and each <em>Channel</em>. It measures
the lost degrees of freedom due to modeling (and filtering) of the
raw signals, and it is critical for calculating proper noise weights
that remain stable in a iterated framework. Failure to count
Dependents correctly and accurately can result in divergent
weighting, which in turn manifests in over-flagging and/or severe
mapping artifacts. Every modeling step keeps track of its own
dependents this way in the analysis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ChannelDivision</strong>: A collection of <em>ChannelGroups</em> according to some
grouping principle. For example, the channels that are read out through
a particular SQUID multiplexer (MUX) comprise a <em>ChannelGroup</em> for that
particular SQUID. The collection of MUX groups over all the SQUID MUXes
constitute a <em>ChannelDivision</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mode</strong>: An object that represents how a <em>ChannelGroup</em> responds to
a <em>Signal</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Modality</strong>: A collection of <em>Modes</em> of a common type. Just as <em>Modes</em>
are inherently linked to a <em>ChannelGroup</em>, <em>Modalities</em> are linked to
<em>ChannelDivisions</em>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><span class="caption-number">Fig. 119 </span><span class="caption-text">Principal scan data classes.  Channels has a set of ChannelDivisions.
ChannelDivision is composed of ChannelGroups, which inherit from
ChannelData.  Modality depends on ChannelDivision and is composed of
Modes.  Mode depends on ChannelGroup and depends on Signal.  Scan is
composed of Integrations.  Integration has a collection of Frames,

collection of Dependents; Signal depends on Dependents.</span><a class="headerlink" href="#scan-data" title="Link to this image">¶</a></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For example, the HAWC instrument is modeled as a set of Channels, i.e. pixels,
for which each has a row and a column index within a subarray.  The raw
timestream of data from the channels is modeled as a set of Frames,
contained within an Integration. To decorrelate the rows of
the HAWC detector, a Modality is created from “rows” ChannelDivision. This
modality contains Modes generated for each ChannelGroup with a particular row
index (row=0, row=1, etc.).  Each mode is associated with a Signal, which
contains the correlated signals for the row, determines and updates gain
increments, subtracts them from the time samples in the Frames, and updates the
dependents associated with the Frames and ChannelData.</p>
<p>The reduction process is run from the class <strong>Reduction</strong>, which performs
the reduction in a <strong>Pipeline</strong> instance, and
produces a <strong>SourceModel</strong> (see <a class="reference internal" href="../../../sofia_redux/scan/scan_architecture.html#scan-process"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 132</span></a>).
A <em>Reduction</em> may create a set of sub-reductions to run in parallel,
for processing a group of separate but associated source models.  These
sub-reductions are used, for example, to process HAWC+ R and T subarrays
separately for Scan-Pol data.</p>
<p>Each <em>Pipeline</em> is in charge of reducing a group of <em>Scans</em>
mostly independently (apart from resulting in a combined <em>SourceModel</em>).
The <em>Pipeline</em> iteratively reduces each <em>Scan</em> by repeatedly executing
a set of tasks, defined by a <strong>Configuration</strong> class.  Metadata for
the observation, including the <em>Configuration</em> and instrument information,
is managed by an <strong>Info</strong> class associated with the <em>Reduction</em>.</p>

<h3>Redux Architecture<a class="headerlink" href="#redux-architecture" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<section id="design">
<h4>Design<a class="headerlink" href="#design" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Redux is designed to be a light-weight interface to data reduction
pipelines.  It contains the definitions of how reduction algorithms
should be called for any given instrument, mode, or pipeline,
in either a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user
interface (GUI) mode, but it does not contain the reduction
algorithms themselves.</p>
<p>Redux is organized around the principle that
any data reduction procedure can be accomplished by running a linear
sequence of data reduction steps. It relies on a <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Reduction</span></code> class that
defines what these steps are and in which order they should be run
(the reduction “recipe”).  Reductions have an associated <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Parameter</span></code>
class that defines what parameters the steps may accept.  Because
reduction classes share common interaction methods, they can be
instantiated and called from a completely generic front-end GUI,
which provides the capability to load in raw data files, and then:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>set the parameters for a reduction step,</p></li>
<li><p>run the step on all input data,</p></li>
<li><p>display the results of the processing,</p></li>
</ol>
<p>and repeat this process for every step in sequence to complete the
reduction on the loaded data. In order to choose the correct
reduction object for a given data set, the interface uses a <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Chooser</span></code>
class, which reads header information from loaded input files and
uses it to decide which reduction object to instantiate and return.</p>
<p>The GUI is a PyQt  application, based around the <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Application</span></code>
class. Because the GUI operations are completely separate from the
reduction operations, the automatic pipeline script is simply a wrapper
around a reduction object: the <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Pipe</span></code> class uses the Chooser to
instantiate the Reduction, then calls its <em>reduce</em> method, which calls
each reduction step in order and reports any output files generated.
Both the Application and Pipe classes inherit from a common <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Interface</span></code>
class that holds reduction objects and defines the methods for
interacting with them.  The <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Application</span></code> class additionally may
start and update custom data viewers associated with the
data reduction; these should inherit from the Redux <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Viewer</span></code> class.</p>
<p>All reduction classes inherit from the generic <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Reduction</span></code> class,
which defines the common interface for all reductions: how parameters
are initialized and modified, how each step is called.
Each specific reduction class must then define
each data reduction step as a method that calls the appropriate
algorithm.</p>
<p>The reduction methods may contain any code necessary to
accomplish the data reduction step. Typically, a reduction method will
contain code to fetch the parameters for the method from the object’s
associated Parameters class, then will
call an external data reduction algorithm with appropriate parameter values,
and store the results in the ‘input’ attribute to be available for the
next processing step. If processing results in data that can be displayed,
it should be placed in the ‘display_data’ attribute, in a format that
can be recognized by the associated Viewers.  The Redux GUI checks
this attribute at the end of each data reduction step and displays the
contents via the Viewer’s ‘display’ method.</p>
<p>Parameters for data reduction are stored as a list of <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ParameterSet</span></code>
objects, one for each reduction step.  Parameter sets contain the key,
value, data type, and widget type information for every parameter.
A <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Parameters</span></code> class may generate these parameter sets by
defining a default dictionary that associates step names with parameter
lists that define these values.  This dictionary may be defined directly
in the Parameters class, or may be read in from an external configuration
file or software package, as appropriate for the reduction.</p>

<section id="hawc-redux">
<h4>HAWC Redux<a class="headerlink" href="#hawc-redux" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>To interface to the HAWC DRP pipeline, Redux defines the <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">HAWCReduction</span></code> and
<code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">HAWCParameters</span></code> classes.  See <a class="reference internal" href="#redux-class"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 122</span></a> for a sketch of
the Redux classes used by the HAWC pipeline.  The HAWCReduction class
holds the DRP DataFits objects and calls the DRP Step classes.  The
HAWCParameters class reads from the DRP configuration object.</p>
<p>The <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">HAWCParameters</span></code> class uses the DRP
configuration file to define all parameters for DRP steps.
Additionally, it adds a set of control parameters that the
HAWCReduction class uses to determine if the output of a reduction
step should be saved or displayed after processing.</p>
<p>The <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">HAWCReduction</span></code> class also uses the DRP configuration file to
determine pipeline modes and data processing recipes for all input
files.  Instead of implementing a method for each reduction step, it
calls a single method for each step: the <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">run_drp_step</span></code> method
looks up the appropriate DRP Step class from the pipeline step name,
and calls it on the data in the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input" title="(in Python v3.12)"><code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">input</span></code></a> attribute.</p>
<p>Since raw HAWC data is very large, Redux defines some of the initial
data reduction steps as a combination of several DRP steps.  This
allows one raw file to be loaded into memory at a time, and only
the smaller intermediate products to be passed along to the next
reduction step.  These pipeline step overrides are defined in a
constant called STEPLISTS, in the HAWCParameters class.  The
super-step methods are defined as <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">make_flats</span></code> and <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">demodulate</span></code>
methods in the HAWCReduction class.</p>
<p>HAWC data is displayed in the DS9 FITS viewer after each step, via
the <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">QADViewer</span></code> class provided by the Redux package.</p>

<h2>Appendix: Raw FITS File Format<a class="headerlink" href="#appendix-raw-fits-file-format" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The following sections describe the format of raw HAWC FITS files. This
may be of interest to the developer, particularly for understanding and
maintaining the early pipeline steps.</p>
<section id="file-names">
<h3>File Names<a class="headerlink" href="#file-names" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The SOFIA filename format for pipeline products is described in the DCS
documentation. This describes the format as it was adapted for the HAWC
instrument in the in the fall of 2016. Examples of filenames:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>RAW inflight:
2016-10-04_HA_F334_040_IMA_83_0003_21_HAWA_HWPA_RAW.fits</p></li>
<li><p>Reduced inflight:
2016-10-04_HA_F334_040_IMA_83_0003_21_HAWA_HWPA_MRG.fits</p></li>
<li><p>RAW Unknown / Lab:
2015-04-09_HA_XXXX_040_unk_unk_HAWA_HWPA_RAW.fits</p></li>
<li><p>Reduced Unknown / Lab:
2015-04-09_HA_XXXX_040_unk_unk_HAWA_HWPA_MRG.fits</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The first part (2016-10-04_HA_F334) is the mission id. If there is no
mission id, that part contains the date with HA_XXXX. 040 is the file
number for that flight / lab day. For Lab and diagnostic data, this
number restarts at midnight, but NOT for Flights. IMA the instrument
configuration (IMA / POL - short versions of the longer INSTCFG values),
83_0003_21 is the AOR-ID. The AOR-ID field is used to store different
information for lab or diagnostic data (ex: scan number for lab scans).
HAWA and HWPA stand for the spectral elements (SPECTEL1 and SPECTEL2 -
with “_” and initial “HAW” removed), RAW/MRG are the data reduction
status acronym. The following list contains the most commonly used data
reduction status acronyms. A full list is in the DRP User’s Manual.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>RAW: Raw file as stored by the HAWC data acquisition software</p></li>
<li><p>STK: Data product with stokes I (intensity), Q and U images from one
HWP cycle (or one nod cycle for C2N data). (Level 1.5)</p></li>
<li><p>MRG: Merged image from multiple dither positions. (Level 2)</p></li>
<li><p>CAL: Calibrated data (Level 3)</p></li>
<li><p>VEC: Calculate valid polarization vectors (Level 4)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Filename format before December 2016 as it was adapted in the fall of
2015:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>RAW inflight: F0200_HC_IMA_83000321_HAWA_HWPA_RAW_040.fits</p></li>
<li><p>Reduced inflight: F0200_HC_IMA_83000321_HAWA_HWPA_MRG_040.fits</p></li>
<li><p>RAW Lab: L150409_HC_IMA_00000000_HAWA_HWPA_RAW_040.fits</p></li>
<li><p>Reduced Lab: L150409_HC_IMA_00000000_HAWA_HWPA_MRG_040.fits</p></li>
<li><p>RAW Unknown: X150409_HC_IMA_00000000_HAWA_HWPA_RAW_040.fits</p></li>
<li><p>Reduced Unknown:
X150409_HC_IMA_00000000_HAWA_HWPA_MRG_040.fits</p></li>
</ul>
<p>F0200 is the flight number. L150409 designates lab data and date,
X150409 designates undetermined data and the date. HC stands for HAWC,
IMA for instrument configuration, 83000321 is the AOR ID, 00000000 is
the AOR-ID as generated in the lab or unknown. Spectral elements, data
reduction acronyms and file number are described above.</p>

columns 64-95 for T0, and columns 96-127 for T1. The merged array is
a int[41][128] in C/Java, which correponds to TDIM=’(128,41)’ in
FITS. Rows 1 through 40 are bolometer data, while row 41 contains
dark SQUID measurements. (TUNITn = ‘counts’). Currently each count
corresponds to .06 pA on the SQUID input.</p>
